The rationale is that freezing temperatures prevent the bacteria responsible for bad smells from surviving. This approach is recommended, particularly during the summer when the smell tends to worsen. Additionally, exposing the footwear to sunlight after use is advised. Trying this method may help effectively address and eliminate undesirable odors, making it a practical solution for maintaining freshness in various types of footwear.']}, 'raw_text': [\"uri: 528339\\nquestion: Is there ANY way to get bad smell out of shoes/boots???\\ncontext: My husbands work boots smell terrible from foot odor, is there anything that I can use to make the smell go away???
