      "An ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. There are two main types of ulcers- Peptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. Duodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. How do you know if you have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. Intense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. There may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. There are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium \"H. pylori\" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. Some medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding",
      "Tense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. \"The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide\" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. Although uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. When a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage.",

      "many people who were diagnosed with them and they were nothing.Here's some info from webmd:In particular, they occur in many healthy children, who may or may not outgrow them as adults. They may also occur during pregnancy. Such murmurs are called \"innocent\" heart murmurs. They are not associated with medical or heart conditions, and do not require treatment or lifestyle changes.Though many murmurs are innocent, some may indicate serious heart problems. For instance, heart murmurs may be caused by blood flowing through a heart valve made leaky or narrow by disease. Murmurs can also be caused by increased blood flow across a valve as a result of medical conditions such as anemia or hypothyroidism. Congenital cardiac defects (heart problems present at birth) can also cause heart murmurs. These often can be repaired with surgery.Within the heart there are four chambers separated from each other by valves, or flaps, that regulate how much blood enters each chamber at any time. Healthy valves also help prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction in your heart.A healthy heart makes a \"lub-dub\" sound as it beats. The \"lub\" (systolic sound) happens when part of the heart contracts and the mitral and tricuspid valves close, and the \"dub\" (diastolic sound) occurs when part of the heart relaxes and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. A heart murmur is an extra sound, such as a whooshing, in the heartbeat caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves.Heart murmurs can be heard through a stethoscope and often are detected during routine physical examinations. On further examination, your doctor may find that the heart murmur is innocent. If your heart murmur is related to more serious heart problems, your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist). Medication or surgery may be recommended to treat the underlying problem. He or she may also suggest that you take extra precautions against getting a heart infection, such as by taking antibiotics when you have dental work or some surgeries. With thorough examination and proper tests, your doctor should be able to tell what causes your heart murmur.SymptomsMany people with heart murmurs experience no symptoms. However, some murmurs can occur in conjunction with these other symptoms:    * Chest pain    * Rapid heartbeat (palpitations)    * Breathlessness    * Fatigue    * Bluish skin color or fingertips (sometimes seen in babies with congenital heart defects",

    ],
    "span_summary": "You personally received a diagnosis of a heart murmur a few years ago, but when checked by a cardiologist, it was deemed not concerning. Many people, including healthy children and pregnant individuals, may have \"innocent\" heart murmurs that do not require treatment. Some heart murmurs, however, can indicate serious heart problems, such as valve issues or congenital defects. The heart murmur is an extra sound, like a whooshing, caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves. It can be detected during routine physical examinations and, if necessary, further examination by a cardiologist. Symptoms may include chest pain, rapid heartbeat, breathlessness, fatigue, and bluish skin color in some cases. A heart murmur could also be associated with a hole in the heart. Thorough examination and appropriate tests help determine the cause of the heart murmur, and treatment may involve medication, surgery, or precautions against infections. The sound of a heart murmur is distinct from normal heart sounds and is audible through a stethoscope."

Plugged pores can develop into acne blemishes.          o Scrubbing excessively with any over-the-counter preparation can actually cause acne to worsen by additionally irritating the hair follicles.    * Prescription medications: Doctors can prescribe medications when acne becomes moderate to severe or is not controlled by over-the-counter medications. Prescription drugs can be used effectively alone or in combination with other prescription and nonprescription medications.          o Antibiotics: Antibiotics can be effective in treating most inflammatory acne (papules and pustules).

We now know that using a combination of 2 medications together may be very effective in treating acne. Using a topical antibiotic with topical benzoyl peroxide, for example, may prevent bacterial resistance to the antibiotic. Giving an antibiotic by mouth is often needed for acne that is more extensive, red, and tender.                + Antibiotics taken by mouth can be associated with more side effects than if applied to the skin and may interact with other medicines such as birth control pills.

Plugged pores can develop into acne blemishes.          o Scrubbing excessively with any over-the-counter preparation can actually cause acne to worsen by additionally irritating the hair follicles.    * Prescription medications: Doctors can prescribe medications when acne becomes moderate to severe or is not controlled by over-the-counter medications. Prescription drugs can be used effectively alone or in combination with other prescription and nonprescription medications.          o Antibiotics: Antibiotics can be effective in treating most inflammatory acne (papules and pustules). They work by killing the bacteria and also by decreasing the redness and swelling seen in the inflammatory forms of acne.                + Antibiotics may be applied to the skin in the form of gels and lotions, or by way of pills. We now know that using a combination of 2 medications together may be very effective in treating acne. Using a topical antibiotic with topical benzoyl peroxide, for example, may prevent bacterial resistance to the antibiotic. Giving an antibiotic by mouth is often needed for acne that is more extensive, red, and tender.                + Antibiotics taken by mouth can be associated with more side effects than if applied to the skin and may interact with other medicines such as birth control pills. Sensitivity to the sun can result in a \"bad sunburn\" in some people who take the antibiotic tetracycline by mouth.          o Retinoids: Medicines made from vitamin A (retinoids) are useful in treating several types of acne lesions. Topical retinoids are effective in treating the noninflammatory types of acne (blackheads and whiteheads).                + Topical retinoids (applied directly to the skin) help to open clogged pores by creating a mild peeling effect. Drying of the skin can be a frequent side effect. Oral retinoids are reserved for treating the more extensive nodular type of acne or severe inflammatory acne, which has not responded to other treatments. Oral retinoids not only have a peeling effect but also decrease the production of oil.                + They can also be associated with a number of serious side effects including birth defects in babies of wom",

For self-care, individuals can wash their face once or twice daily using soap or over-the-counter cleansers, avoiding excessive scrubbing. Over-the-counter medications with benzoyl peroxide can be used, along with noncomedogenic cover-up products. In more severe cases, prescription treatments like antibiotics (topical or oral) and retinoids may be recommended. It's essential to follow directions, be consistent in application, and consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice, considering potential side effects and interactions."

    "spans": [
      "The skin of your finger consists of tiny little skin cells, 100's and 100's of millions of them.  Each cell is so small you would need a powerful microscope for looking at 100 of them.All cells are surrounded by a membrane.  Somewhat like a very, very tiny balloon filled with salty jello.  The insides of the outermost cells are salty and dehydrated because your skin grows from underneath, the dermis, close to the capillaries (blood supply).The outer skin, called the epidermis, consists of cells which are wearing out and drying up, although they are mostly not quite dead yet.  The very oldest ones that are dead come off when you scrub or shower. Some are falling off all the time, but they are so small you do not see them.Since the epidermis consists of rather dry cells, it is able to absorb water.  The cell walls allow the water in your tub, shower, or pool to penetrate into each cell.  The insides, being salty, are have a strong affinity for water.  If you spend a long time in the water, the epidermal cells swell up, increasing in size, somewhat like the the balloons mentioned earlier being filled with more water.When the skin on the outside of your hands or toes swells it has more surface area than previously.  Instead of being like a tight fitting glove, it becomes more like a glove that is too big.If you put on a glove that is too big, it will have wrinkles instead of being stretched smoothly.The entry of water into a cell is called osmosis.  If you stay in fresh water for an extremely long time, many cells will absorb so much water they will burst.  That is called lysis.Red blood cells are much more fragile than skin cells.  When combined with fresh water they rapidly absorb so much water that they all appear to dissolve.  Each one of the millions and millions of red blood cells has burst.  That is called hemolysis.Ropes made from plant fibers are also composed of cells.  Test a rope:  See if it shrinks in length when absorbing water or drying out.When the skin on your fingers and toes dries out, the cells shrink in size, and the skin becomes more smooth and taut, like a tight, well fitted glove.Your skin is very important.  Without it you would be just like a raw piece of meat, ready for the flies and germs to eat.Take good care of your skin.  Do not get sunburned.  When you have a bad cut that is healing, you should try to keep your hands out of dirty water or ponds.These contain potentially dangerous bacteria that could infect your open or healing wound.Taking a shower or washing your hands in clean water is okay.  Just be sure to put antibiotic ointment and a fresh bandage over the cut when you are done.Your teacher might be able to show you some pictures of bacteria (germs) or let you look at live ones through a microscope.  Only one person is allowed to look through at a time.  Everyone else must stand back and not push the observer or touch their head.  Otherwise you could injure one of their eyes or both by knocking them into the eyepiece or binoculars of the microscope.Some people have gone blind that way.  No horsing around !!  Strictly enforced.During winter, good skin care means putting lotion on your hands and wearing gloves while outside in the cold winter air.People who drink a carrot milkshake daily, made in a blender, have very beautiful skin once they have done this for six months.Healthy skin makes both boys and girls look better.",

The outermost layer, the epidermis, consists of cells that are drying out and wearing out, continually replenished by the growth from underneath, the dermis. The epidermis can absorb water, allowing it to penetrate the cells and cause them to swell, akin to balloons filling with water. When skin swells, it increases in surface area, resembling a loose-fitting glove with wrinkles instead of a smooth, taut surface. Osmosis, the entry of water into cells, occurs during this process. Prolonged exposure to water can lead to cell bursting, known as lysis. Conversely, when the skin dries out, cells shrink, resulting in a smoother and taut appearance. Proper skin care is emphasized, including avoiding sunburn, keeping wounds clean, and moisturizing during winter. The importance of skin is highlighted as a protective barrier against external elements. Overall, good skin care contributes to a healthier and more appealing appearance for both boys and girls."

CMV without symptoms is common in babies and young children. It is found in saliva, urine, semen, and other body fluids. The virus is easily spread in households and in daycare centers. It can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy and to the baby during delivery or in breast milk.Over half of women of childbearing age become infected with CMV at least six months before becoming pregnant. There appear to be few risks for complications of CMV for this group and only a few babies have the infection at birth. These babies appear to have no significant illness or abnormalities.About 90 percent of babies who are infected with CMV have no symptoms at birth. But as many as 15 percent of these babies develop one or more neurological abnormalities — such as mental retardation, learning disabilities, hearing or vision loss — usually in the first year or two of life. Congenital CMV infection is a leading cause of hearing loss in children.About one in 1,000 babies (about 4,000 babies each year) shows symptoms of CMV at birth. These symptoms may include an enlarged spleen or liver, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and a distinctive rash. Up to 20 percent of these babies die, and about 90 percent of the survivors suffer from serious neurological defects, such as mental retardation.At present there is no treatment that can halt or reverse the effects of congenital CMV.

The advice given is to monitor the diet more closely to improve the A1C level. The suggestion emphasizes the importance of aiming for a reading closer to 100 for better long-term health outcomes."

Sexual dysfunction is an interesting one because many times the cause is something physical.

Dysfunction is one of the leading indicators that there are other things going on that need to be checked out.  If every thing is ok and you want a little boost, hypnosis can be great.  Doing it with your partner can be wonderful. Much of hypnosis is about belief and trust.  Making the avenues of communication and trust stronger between partners will always help. In the case of inhibition, hypnosis is not mind control.  It can't be use to make you do something that you don't want to do.  It can be used to make you more comfortable with an idea that you chose to explore.  It can be use to help you explore why you are uncomfortable with a subject and if these inhibitions are something you want to modify.

There are many viruses that cause head-colds (acute rhinitis) and simply not being warm (no coat, gloves, etc) will not cause you to have acute rhinitis. You must be exposed to the virus before you can \"catch a cold.\" Sneezing causes airborne particles.  Someone who sneezes and has the virus can allow you to get the a cold.  Touching someone or something that has a virus on it can cause you to get a cold (acute rhinitis).The virus enters your body by way of your eye, nose, or mouth. Hand-washing is an excellent way to minimize the chance you'll catch a cold",
      "Both. Yes, you do get colds from airborn or surface viruses. However, your mother is right because being cold will lower your resistance and your immune system",

      "For instance, Mom is cold at 72 degrees and that's just too hot for me.  In the research that has been done, \"cold\" is usually around 40 degrees with their feet in cold water. Even spending quite a bit of time like this, people were still no more likely to catch a cold when directly exposed to cold germs.Another reason I point out the relativity of being cold.  This idea has been around a long, long time.  When I read books written in the 1800s, the characters will talk about breaking the ice that had formed on the bedside water pitcher.  These people were sleeping in temperatures far colder than most people in developed countries can even conceive of.Still, it does seem like people get more colds during winter. It should be noted that this is the same whether you are in Chicago or LA. It's possible that germs like it a touch cooler than we do, or it's possible we simply stay inside more, which leads to a greater chance of being exposed to other peoples colds (also, there's a lot more travelling and socializing in November/December - yet more chances to catch a cold).  It could be that a good number of cases of colds are just \"cold stress\" - a reaction our bodies have to sudden changes in weather.  I know that my nose will run whenever we get a cold front come through.  We have no real data, even on whether there really are more colds in the winter.  So it's hard to tell why we get more colds during the winter.  But getting cold doesn't seem to be that much of a culprit",
      "3: When you are cold, your body can't protect itself as well from illness because it turns its attention to protecting you from the cold itself.  If you wear the hat and gloves and coat, when you are exposed to germs in the air and on surfaces, you will be more able to fight it off before it makes you really ill"

Airborne particles from sneezing or touching surfaces with the virus can introduce it to the body through the eyes, nose, or mouth. Hand-washing is recommended to minimize the risk of catching a cold. While being cold itself does not directly make you more susceptible to colds, there is a correlation between colder weather and an increase in colds, possibly due to factors such as spending more time indoors and increased exposure to others' colds. Wearing appropriate clothing in cold conditions is advised for overall health and immune system support."

The traditional treatment for hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone replacement, which involves taking a prescription drug (T4, T3, or a combination product containing both T4 and T3) that acts similarly in the body to the human hormone thyroxine that the thyroid would normally produce. Armour™ Thyroid, one of several drugs available for the treatment of hypothyroidism, is a naturally derived thyroid replacement containing both T4 and T31. Other products are available which contain synthetic T4 and/or synthetic T3"

    "span_summary": "For information purposes, armour™ Thyroid is a natural alternative for thyroid hormone replacement, particularly in cases of underactive or nonfunctioning thyroid, or when the thyroid has been partially or completely removed surgically, leading to hypothyroidism. Diagnosis is typically made by a physician, and traditional treatment involves thyroid hormone replacement. This includes prescription drugs like T4, T3, or a combination containing both. Armour™ Thyroid is one such medication, derived naturally and containing both T4 and T3. While other products are available with synthetic T4 and/or T3, Armour™ Thyroid offers a natural option for individuals requiring thyroid hormone replacement therapy."

      "From emedicine:  Scleroderma is a systemic disease that affects many organ systems. It is most obvious in the skin; however, the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory, renal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems, as well as numerous vascular structures, are involved frequently. The symptoms result from progressive tissue fibrosis and occlusion of the microvasculature by excessive production and deposition of types I and III collagens. Other macromolecules found in the connective tissue (eg, glycosaminoglycans, tenascin, fibronectin) also are increased. The vascular alterations show a predilection for affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. The small vessel cytoskeleton is affected by structural defects that lead to collapse. Next, the tight junctions become altered and are no longer functional, allowing the endothelium to slip into the vessel lumen.From webmd:  Scleroderma (pronounced SKLEER-oh-der-ma) is Greek for hard skin. It's classified as both a connective-tissue disorder and a rheumatic condition. In scleroderma, the skin gradually tightens and thickens or hardens. It loses its ability to stretch. Tiny blood vessels throughout the body also may be affected, causing widespread damage to the internal organ"

The guidance also encourages consuming smaller, more frequent meals to prevent the body from interpreting it as starvation and storing fat. An alternative approach involves the \"rice diet,\" limiting daily calorie intake to approximately 1200 calories through a cup of rice and a piece of fruit per meal, potentially resulting in significant weight loss within a week.

    "perspective": "INFORMATION",
    "spans": [
      "The aortic valve is the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta.  This is where fresh oxygenated blood is pumped out to the entire body.  There are a variety of diseases that can require replacement of this valve, including aortic stenosis where the valve does not properly open and close, or an aortic insufficiency where the valve allows backflow of blood from the aorta back into the left ventricle of the heart.There are two major types of aortic valve replacements - mechanical valves and biologic/tissue valves.  Mechanical valves have been around longer and subsequently have a very refined safety and efficacy profile.  The downside is that after the procedure, the patient must be put on blood thinners for the rest of their life.  Biologic/tissue valves do not need subsequent blood thinner treatment and therefore may benefit younger, generally healthy patients.  However, it has been shown that the durability of tissue valves may be lower than mechanical valves, which may require a repeat operation later in life.There is a variation to the above procedures called the Ross procedure.  This procedure replaces the faulty aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve.  The pulmonary valve is then replaced with a tissue valve.  The rationale for doing this is that more strain is put on the aortic valve and therefore having the person's own anatomy in that place is preferable to having a weaker mechanical or tissue valve.  The pulmonary valve, which only pumps to the lungs (and therefore doesn't have to pump as hard) can withstand having a tissue valve, which isn't as durable.  In addition, this approach does not require blood thinners after the operation.Current cardiac surgery research is trying to investigate if valve replacement can be done in a minimally invasive way using catheter devices",
      ": it replaces one of the valves in your heart (which function to move the blood to the rest of the body from the heart) to improve blood flow",
      "The aortic valve is a semilunar valve that controls blood flow from the left ventricle to the systemic system of the body.. Its only job is to close so that backflow of blood back to the left ventricle will not be attained.. If the valve is not functioning properly the person's diastolic pressure will increase which will ultimately cause a cardiac infarction. The actual replacement can be achieved, but it is a very delicate surgery because the aorta is the biggest blood vessel in the body. Usually an aortic bypass is performed"

    "span_summary": "For information purposes, the aortic valve serves as the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta, facilitating the flow of fresh oxygenated blood throughout the body. Diseases such as aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency may necessitate the replacement of this valve. There are two primary types of aortic valve replacements: mechanical valves, which have a well-established safety record but require lifelong blood thinners, and biologic/tissue valves, which eliminate the need for blood thinners but may have lower durability. The Ross procedure presents a variation, replacing the aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve and using a tissue valve for the pulmonary position. This approach minimizes strain on the aortic valve and avoids the need for postoperative blood thinners. Current research explores minimally invasive catheter-based methods for valve replacement. Proper functioning of the aortic valve is crucial to prevent complications such as increased diastolic pressure and the risk of cardiac infarction. Aortic bypass surgery is often performed to address a malfunctioning aortic valve, acknowledging the complexity of the procedure due to the aorta's significance as the body's largest blood vessel."

The disease takes its less-scientific name from Lou Gehrig, a baseball player with the New York Yankees in the late 1920s and 1930s, who was forced to retire in 1939 as a result of the loss of motor control caused by the disease. In 1991, a team of researchers linked familial ALS to chromosome 21. Two years later, the SOD1 gene was identified as being associated with many cases of familial ALS. The enzyme coded for by SOD1 carries out a very important function in cells: it removes dangerous superoxide radicals by converting them into non-harmful substances. Defects in the action of this enzyme mean that the superoxide radicals attack cells from the inside, causing their death. Several different mutations in this enzyme all result in ALS, making the exact molecular cause of the disease difficult to ascertain.Recent research has suggested that treatment with drugs called antioxidants may benefit ALS patients. However, since the molecular genetics of the disease are still unclear, a significant amount of research is still required to design other promising treatments for ALS"

      "that matches the symptons here:PFIC (Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis)What is Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC)Taken word for word, it means: Progressive: tending to get worse over time; Familial: passed down to a child from the parents by way of the genes; Intrahepatic: involves disease inside the liver and not the bile ducts outside the liver; Cholestasis: means poor bile flow and build-up of substances in the liver that should be put into bile. The symptoms of PFICFIC1 and BSEP disease cause similar symptoms; together they are called low-GGT PFIC because of a blood test (GGT) that is low rather than high as in most other forms of cholestasis. These diseases cause cholestasis that begins in early childhood, with the average age at onset being 3 months. However, some patients do not get symptoms of cholestasis until they are teenagers or young adults. These diseases can progress quickly to bad scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) in the first year of life or more slowly with minimal scarring well into the teenage years. Few patients have survived beyond 20 years without treatment. Itching (pruritus) is the main symptom of cholestasis in many patients. Pruritus is often out of proportion to the level of jaundice (yellow eyes or skin), which is often low-grade and can wax and wane. Scratching starts as digging at the ears and eyes, which are the first areas to show bleeding and scarring. The itching may be very disabling and does not usually respond to medications. The scratching interferes with normal activities and sleep and may interfere with learning and schoolwork. Problems with growth are another major feature of PFIC. Almost all patients are short for their age, but they may not be thin. Delayed puberty and sexual development is common. Patients who are treated can have normal sexual development and several have given birth to normal children. Other common problems include frequent nosebleeds and wheezing. Fat-soluble vitamin (A, E, D and K) deficiencies are common in untreated patients. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to problems with vision. Vitamin E deficiency can lead to problems with balance, strength and coordination. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to poor bone formation. Vitamin K deficiency can lead to bleeding problems. For these reasons, most patients need extra vitamins. Up to a third of patients have gallstones. Most patients have an enlarged liver or enlarged spleen. Although similar, there are differences between patients with BSEP disease and those with FIC1 disease. For example, patients with FIC1 disease are more likely to have watery diarrhea, which can be severe, especially after liver transplantation. However, there is much that we do not yet know about these differences and this will only become clear as more patients are studied.Patients with PFIC but with high serum GGT have been called PFIC3, and are now called MDR3 disease. These patients have very bad cholestasis in the first year of life, which may progress in the first few years of life toward failure of the liver to do its normal functions. However, there are probably less severe forms of MDR3 disease that cause milder disease. The child and his family may first become aware that there is something wrong during school age or adolescence. Sometimes, problems may not appear until adulthood. The full spectrum of liver problems caused by MDR3 disease is just now becoming known"
    ],
    "span_summary": "Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) is a genetic disorder characterized by worsening cholestasis, a condition involving poor bile flow and the accumulation of substances in the liver. PFIC can be categorized as low-GGT PFIC when associated with FIC1 and BSEP diseases, leading to symptoms such as jaundice, itching (pruritus), and liver scarring (cirrhosis). Onset typically occurs in early childhood but can manifest later into adolescence or adulthood. Itching, often disproportionate to jaundice levels, is a prominent symptom and may be resistant to medications. Growth issues, delayed puberty, frequent nosebleeds, and vitamin deficiencies are common. Patients may also experience gallstones, an enlarged liver, and spleen. PFIC3, now referred to as MDR3 disease, involves severe cholestasis in early life and may progress to liver dysfunction. Variations in symptoms exist between FIC1 disease and BSEP disease, and MDR3 disease may present with milder forms. The understanding of these disorders is evolving as more patients are studied."

T",
      "Regular exercise (I recommend swimming as the most effective) will definitely strengthen your heart, put your blood pressure at normal levels and reduce any sensations of heart palpitations that are associated with panic attacks.Third, take at least 2 hours per day to relax/meditate. I would recommend a combination of yoga, a soak in a hot bath or hot tub and a nap in quiet room with nothing but candles, very soft relaxing music. Turn off the phone, turn off the lights, lock the doors, just relax, breath, meditate. If you can afford massage, I think that is a way to complement this relaxation time.Fourth, when you actually have a panic attack, try this very simple strategy. First say to yourself over and over \"Everything is fine, it's just a panic attack. People have them everyday. It's uncomfortable but it will pass very soon.\" As you repeat this to yourself, breathe in very deeply and very slowly ... breath in for 4-5 seconds, hold for 4-5 seconds and release for 4-5 seconds. Do this sequence 20 times in a row. It will quickly reduce your heart rate and increase oxygen flow to your brain which in turns increases your rationality, thereby reducing your irrationality (the panic).Fifth, read the book I recommend. There are some special diet stratgies, possible food allergies that could be involved and vitamin/mineral supplements that can help you.Sixth, find a therapist that specializes in anxiety/panic disorders.

    "perspective": "SUGGESTION",
    "spans": [
      "In order to be succeed at thinning your waistline, you have to get a basic under standing of how the abdominal muscles function and how your body burns fat.The first thing that you need to understand is the difference between fat and muscle tissue. Fat is created by eating excess calories and it is primarily stored in layers on top of your muscles. Muscle tissue consists of fibers that contract to produce movement.Fat can't turn into muscle, and muscle can't turn into fat. But you can lose muscle mass while you gain fat. That's what happens to most people, especially as they begin to get a little older.So if your goal is a trim waist line and a nice flat stomach, the first thing you need to do is remove the layers of fat that are sitting on top of your abs. Everyone has a flat stomach. It's just that some of them are covered with excess fat. The most effective way to flatten your stomach is with a combination of strength training (placing an extra focus on the mid-section), cardiovascular exercises (short, intensive workouts), and a stable blood sugar level to keep you from adding even more fat (and it makes it easier for the body to use your body fat for fuel). You have to do some type of progressive strength training. The ab muscle is primarily used to flex your torso forward. But there are also muscles that flex your torso to the side and other muscles that rotate it. Often you will see people on their ab roller every day doing lots of sit-ups or crunches. If you want to effectively strengthen your stomach muscles you need to incorporate these exercises:   1-2 forward flexion exercises (sit-up, crunch, etc.)   1-2 side flexion exercises (side crunches, side bends, etc.)   1-2 rotational exercises (standing twists, trunk rotations, etc.)  Your abs are muscles, and just like any other muscles, they should be exercised at most 3 times per week. You also want to make sure you're training them progressively, which means working them harder each time.   Increase metabolism using short, and hard, cardio workouts. Cardio workouts are very important because they can, if done properly, increase your metabolism for up to 24 hours or more!This means that you're less likely to store any excess calories as body fat simply because they're more likely to be used up by your higher metabolism. Plus, you're more likely to burn off some excess body fat in the process! Here's a simple interval workout that you can do with just about any activity (bicycling, walking, swimming, etc).  Warm up at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes   Perform 30 seconds of hard exercise (almost as hard as possible)   perform one minute of moderate exercise (recovery time to catch your breath)   Repeat this process from 6-10 times   Cool down at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes    Maintaining a stable blood sugar level is the key. Most importantly, you have to stabilize your blood sugar level! This is by far the most important factor when it comes to shedding that excess body fat and keeping it off!To stabilize your blood sugar level you have to feed your body frequently, about every 2-3 hours. The key is to give your body only the amount of food that it needs at that time. Your body burns calories all day long, so why would you only feed it once or twice a day?Give your body the fuel it needs: fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins (fish, lean beef, chicken, eggs, etc). Most people pay too much attention to how much fat is in food, or how healthy a meal is. Calories are calories. It doesn’t matter where they come from. If there’s extra it's going to body fat! I'm not saying that what you eat isn't important because it is. It just doesn’t have all that much of an affect when it comes to losing fat. Make healthy choices whenever possible, but don’t feel like every cheeseburger you eat is guaranteed to be st"

    "span_summary": "Achieving a trim waistline involves a comprehensive approach blending targeted strength training, cardiovascular exercises, and stable blood sugar maintenance. Fat, originating from excess calorie intake, overlays abdominal muscles, emphasizing the need for focused exercises. Incorporate a range of movements, including sit-ups, crunches, side bends, twists, and rotations, progressively intensifying sessions up to three times a week. Short and intense cardio, like interval training, boosts metabolism. Crucially, stabilize blood sugar levels by consuming balanced, frequent meals rich in fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins. This multifaceted strategy, encompassing exercise and dietary balance, is key to shedding excess body fat and attaining a flat stomach."

Those who do enjoy caffeinated beverages on a regular basis should do so in moderation.A healthy diet is key for preventing constipation. A high fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts ensures regularity. Consuming an apple every day, with its skin intact, is another sure way to prevent constipation. Guava is another helpful fruit, but it should be eaten with its seeds to ensure the full effect. Starchy foods should be avoided when one is constipated as this will only escalate the problem.Regular exercise will also assist in one’s quest for regularity. Even if it’s a daily stroll in the park, exercise is important.If you’re feeling a little backed up, perhaps one or some of these remedies can help.Laxatives – There are many over the counter products to choose from in price ranges and formulas to suit everyone’s personal preference. If you’re not sure which product is right for you, check with your pharmacist or physician. Either is sure to recommend the product that is right for you. Lemon and Honey – Mix two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of honey into a glass of warm water. Drink one glass in the morning and one in the evening to bring back regularity. Orange Juice and Olive Oil – Drink a glass or mug filled with half each of orange juice and olive oil. It may not taste great but it will have your plumbing running smoothly in no time. Licorice – Licorice has laxative qualities. Eating several pieces of real licorice will help to relieve your constipation. Grapes – A large bunch of grapes should do the trick. Castor oil and honey – Honey seems to appear in many remedies for constipation. In addition to taking it with lemon and even by itself, one can also mix one teaspoon of honey with one teaspoon of castor oil. Something else a person who is suffering from constipation can try is a cup of tomato juice mixed with half a cup of sauerkraut juice and a quarter cup of carrot juice.

Weight gain is also mentioned as a potential factor since breasts are composed of fatty tissue. However, it's essential to note that individual responses to these methods can vary, and factors like genetics and overall health play a role in breast size. Consulting with a healthcare professional or a qualified fitness expert can provide personalized guidance based on individual circumstances and goals."

Hormonal or seasonal changes may make dandruff worse.Here are some tips.Learn to manage stress. Stress affects your overall health, making you susceptible to a number of conditions and diseases. It can even help trigger dandruff or exacerbate existing symptoms. Shampoo often. If you tend to have an oily scalp, daily shampooing to remove the excess oil may help prevent dandruff. Cut back on styling products. Hair sprays, styling gels, mousses and hair waxes can all build up on your hair and scalp, making them oilier. Some people may even develop allergies to various hair-care products. Eat a healthy diet. For overall good health, include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and small amounts of lean protein in your diet. Get a little sun. Sunlight may be good for dandruff. But because exposure to ultraviolet light damages your skin and increases your risk of skin cancer, don't sunbathe. Instead, just spend a little time outdoors. But wear sunscreen on your face and body.",

The difference between the Green tea and the others is that green tea is not fermented, thus keeping in the powerful antioxidants lost in the fermenting process. Green tea also contains polyphenols such as tannins (a nutrient antioxidant) catchins (EGCG which is a powerful antioxidant), and flavenoids, as well as other vitamins and minerals, such as Vitamin C. The antioxidants help your body fight against free radicals, which can mutate cells and make you sick. Numerous scientific discoveries have also linked green tea with remarkable disease preventative properties. Gargling with green tea has been shown to inactivate the flu virus, as has drinking a cup each day to activate the polyphenols (powerful antioxidants) that are also suspected to work well against both the cold and flu viri. As China permits greater access to its interior to scientists, reports grow of entire villages in the green tea growing regions where cancers and sicknesses are statistically lower than the national norm. Though such studies are best classified as emergent, green tea is becoming widely viewed as one of the superfoods of the future. Here are just a few known health benefits of drinking green tea: Boosts your immune system Lowers blood sugar Helps prevent cavities and tooth decay Slows the aging process Helps reduce the risk of cancer Lowers cholesterol Aids in weight loss by burning calories Reduces high blood pressure Prevents arthritis Reduces the risk of heart disease Reduces the risk of stroke Lowers the risk of blood clot Anti-Cancer Compound In Green Tea Identified Researchers at the University of Murcia in Spain (UMU) and the John Innes Center (JIC) in Norwich, England have shown that a compound called EGCG in green tea prevents cancer cells from growing by binding to a specific enzyme. \"We have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs, \" Professor Roger Thorneley, of JIC, told Reuters.

These include sleeping on your belly, losing weight if necessary, maintaining a consistent bedtime for adequate sleep, and sleeping on your side rather than your back. An inventive solution involves sewing a pocket in the back of your pajama top, inserting a tennis ball, and stitching it closed to discourage sleeping on your back. Avoiding alcohol and sedatives before bed, quitting smoking, and elevating the head of your bed by 4 to 6 inches can also be helpful. Promptly addressing breathing problems, using nasal strips to widen nostrils, and trying unconventional methods like tickling the mustache or placing a sugarless candy or cough drop between the cheek and gum are suggested. While the candy method may occasionally pose challenges, these diverse approaches aim to tackle snoring from various angles, offering options for individuals seeking relief."

      "There are several types of leukemia. They are grouped in two ways. One way is by how quickly the disease develops and gets worse. The other way is by the type of blood cell that is affected.Leukemia is either acute or chronic. In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are blasts that remain very immature and cannot carry out their normal functions. The number of blasts increases rapidly, and the disease becomes worse quickly. In chronic leukemia, some blast cells are present, but in general, these cells are more mature and can carry out some of their normal functions. Also, the number of blasts increases less rapidly than in acute leukemia. As a result, chronic leukemia worsens gradually.Leukemia can arise in either of the two main types of white blood cells: lymphoid cells or myeloid cells. When leukemia affects lymphoid cells, it is called lymphocytic leukemia. When myeloid cells are affected, the disease is called myeloid or myelogenous leukemia.These are the most common types of leukemia:1.Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. This disease also affects adults, especially those age 65 and older. 2.Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in both adults and children. This type of leukemia is sometimes called acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). 3.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most often affects adults over the age of 55. It sometimes occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. 4.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurs mainly in adults. A very small number of children also develop this disease. 5.Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon type of chronic leukemia. This and other uncommon types of leukemia are not discussed here. The Cancer Information Service can supply information about them.",

      "Testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers in young men between the ages of 15 and 35, but the disease also occurs in other age groups, so all men should be aware of its symptoms. While testicular cancer is common among young men, young men typically do not develop any kind of cancer, so overall, testicular cancer is a relatively rare disease. This form of cancer is almost always curable if it is found early. Most testicular cancers are found by men themselves, either as a painless lump, a hardening or change in size of the testicle, or pain in the testicle. Children born with an undescended testicle have an increased risk of getting testicular cancer, regardless of whether surgery is done to correct the problem. However, the surgery should still be done to preserve fertility. The theory is that the increased risk of testicular cancer is due to whatever caused the undescended testicle, not just by the fact that the testicle was undescended"

While pain in the testes or scrotum may or may not be present, it's crucial to be aware of any unusual bumps on the testicles. Testicular cancer is more prevalent in young men aged 15 to 35 but can occur in other age groups, necessitating awareness of its symptoms by all men. Although relatively rare, testicular cancer is highly curable if detected early. Men often discover it themselves through the identification of painless lumps, changes in testicle size, or testicular pain. Individuals born with an undescended testicle face an increased risk of testicular cancer, emphasizing the importance of corrective surgery to preserve fertility. The elevated cancer risk is attributed to the underlying cause of the undescended testicle, not solely its undescended state."

Additionally, sublingual B12 supplementation may help manage CTS symptoms; however, it is essential to avoid B12 overdose. One should not exceed 2500 mcg of B12 daily, divided into at least two doses, and continue until pain subsides. Salon Pas patches can provide relief, and lifestyle changes, such as using wrist braces, ergonomic equipment, and altering daily routines, can help prevent CTS. If symptoms persist, consulting a medical professional is crucial for further evaluation and potential nerve removal procedures. Lastly, \"Shark Cartilage\" and \"Glucosamine\" supplements are recommended for joint and bone health."

    "question": "what is Fifth Disease?",
    "perspective": "INFORMATION",
    "spans": [
      "What is \"fifth disease?\"Fifth disease is a mild rash illness that occurs most commonly in children. The ill child typically has a \"slapped-cheek\" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a \"cold\" a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days.What causes fifth disease?Fifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Pet dogs or cats may be immunized against \"parvovirus,\" but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. Therefore, a child cannot \"catch\" parvovirus from a pet dog or cat, and a pet cat or dog cannot catch human parvovirus B19 from an ill child.Can adults get fifth disease?Yes, they can. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease.Is fifth disease contagious?Yes. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash.How does someone get infected with parvovirus B19?Parvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to \"just have a cold.\" The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. In a household, as many as 50% of susceptible persons exposed to a family member who has fifth disease may become infected. During school outbreaks, 10% to 60% of students may get fifth disease.How soon after infection with parvovirus B19 does a person become ill?A susceptible person usually becomes ill 4 to 14 days after being infected with the virus, but may become ill for as long as 20 days after infection.Does everyone who is infected with parvovirus B19 become ill?No. During outbreaks of fifth disease, about 20% of adults and children who are infected with parvovirus B19 do not develop any symptoms. Furthermore, other persons infected with the virus will have a non-specific illness that is not characteristic of fifth disease. Persons infected with the virus, however, do develop lasting immunity that protects them against infection in the future.How is fifth disease diagnosed?A physician can often diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical examination. In cases in which it is important to confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to parvovirus B19 and other germs. If immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to parvovirus B19 is detected, the test result suggests that the person has had a recent infection.Is fifth disease serious?Fifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy. Joint pain and swelling in adults usually resolve without long-term disability.Parvovirus B19 infection may cause a seriou",

If the person dies within two years, the payout is calculated based on the premiums paid. The suggestion is to purchase multiple policies to accumulate enough funds for burial expenses. The recommendation also emphasizes honesty with the life insurance agent to avoid denial of payout later. It's advised to consult with a local life insurance agent for personalized assistance."

      "working out anything past 45 min is a waste of time because you end up destroy your own current muscles for energy, and also leads to overtraining which will also waste your muscle and prevent them from recovering thus will not build you any new muscle. So working out 24 hours a day as stated above is pure stupidity.also 3X 20 sets is another stupid answer which will lead to what i already stated above.now here is the way to build muscle properly and increase the speed in which you will gain them:the secret to gaining muscle is to shock your muscles every work out. this can be done in the following ways:-changing the order of the exercise each work out- changing the speed at which you lift the weights, slow or faster-super sets which means doing two or more opposite or same body part exercises- giant sets which means no rest between all sets performed for a specific body part- negatives which means lowering the weight very slowly after one rep- stripping which means lifting the heaviest weight you can to muscle failure (when you can lift it anymore) for no more than 6-8 repetitions and then going to a slightly lower weight + repeatthat's only a few ways to shock your muscles into growing. Muscles have a memory so you must vary and change your routine and shocking methods constantly.also there is the diet component:proteins: make sure you eat a palm size protein portion every meal, which should be every 3 hours that you arent sleeping and do not eatt 3 hours before going to bed to prevent food from metabolizing into fat.carbs: 2 clenched fists is the ideal portionfats: olive oils, flaxseed oils, peanuts, almonds, no more than 10-12 or a table spoon per meal for the oilsmake sure you do not work the same muscle groups within 48 hours or 2 days to give them time to recover and grow.make sure you sleep at least 8 hours, as much of the recovery occurs during sleep.make sure you eat no more than 1 hour after your work outsmake sure you have a protein shake before going to bed, no other food if possible throw junk food, alcohol, and other tempting food in the garbage. keep your training to 3 sets of 6-8 repetitions per exercise@ 3 exercises per body partany more question, visit this excellent site bellow, and good luck",

A probe is passed into the vagina, which allows a detailed view of the uterus and its contents. blood tests. Levels of hormones such as estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and progesterone are measured, as well as prolactin. hysteroscopy -- a fine tube is passed into the uterus via the cervix under a general anaesthetic. laparoscopy -- tubes are passed into the peritoneal cavity, which is then insufflated with carbon dioxide. This is commonly used to diagnose endometriosis. MRI and CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare. It can be used to delineate the uterine cavity with an injected dye (hysterosalpingogram) and to measure the pelvic girdle.DiseasesThe main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are:cancer of the cervix. The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is a means of detecting this, by obtaining a sample of cervical epithelial cells and examining them under a microscope for malignant changes. All women are encouraged to have pap smears at regular intervals after commencing intercourse. incontinence of urine. amenorrhoea (absent periods) dysmenorrhoea (painful periods) infertility menorrhagia (heavy periods).

Investigations may include abdominal and vaginal ultrasounds, blood tests for hormone levels, hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, and imaging studies like MRI or CT scans. Conditions treated by gynaecologists include cervical cancer, incontinence, amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea, infertility, menorrhagia, and prolapse. The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is commonly used for detecting cervical cancer, and various treatments are provided based on the specific condition. In the United States, some health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care."

A bout of hiccups generally resolves by itself, although many home remedies are in circulation to shorten the duration, and medication is occasionally necessary. By extension, the term \"hiccup\" is also used to describe a small and unrepeated aberration in an otherwise consistent pattern. The medical term is singultus.While many cases develop spontaneously, hiccups are known to develop often in specific situations, such as eating too quickly, taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal, eating very hot or spicy food, laughing vigorously or coughing, or drinking an excess of an alcoholic beverage. Hiccups may be caused by pressure to the phrenic nerve by other anatomical structures, or rarely by tumors.",

The term \"hiccup\" is also metaphorically used to describe minor deviations in an otherwise consistent pattern. These spasms can be triggered by diverse factors such as eating too quickly, consuming hot or spicy foods, laughing vigorously, or drinking excessively. Hiccups may also arise from anatomical pressure on the phrenic nerve or, rarely, due to tumors. Irritation to the diaphragm, a muscle aiding in breathing, is the underlying cause of hiccups.

Carbohydrates are defined as sugars or foods that convert into sugar in the body, with examples ranging from pasta and potatoes to cookies and bread. The text discusses the Atkins diet, a notable no-carb approach, recognizing its effectiveness in initial weight loss but noting the challenges of long-term adherence. It further delves into the broader category of low-carb diets, encompassing various popular plans and approaches, and emphasizes the distinction between short-term very low carb phases and more sustainable reduced carbohydrate diets. The discussion extends to the unique diet of Alaska's Inuit natives, centered around meat and devoid of carbs, highlighting potential challenges and nutritional deficiencies when cooking the meat."

Most notably, crucial immune cells called CD4+ T cells are disabled and killed during the typical course of infection. These cells, sometimes called \"T-helper cells,\" play a central role in the immune response, signaling other cells in the immune system to perform their special functions. A healthy, uninfected person usually has 800 to 1,200 CD4+ T cells per cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood. During HIV infection, the number of these cells in a person's blood progressively declines. When a person's CD4+ T cell count falls below 200/mm3, he or she becomes particularly vulnerable to the opportunistic infections and cancers that typify AIDS, the end stage of HIV disease. People with AIDS often suffer infections of the lungs, intestinal tract, brain, eyes and other organs, as well as debilitating weight loss, diarrhea, neurologic conditions and cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma and certain types of lymphomas. Most scientists think that HIV causes AIDS by directly inducing the death of CD4+ T cells or interfering with their normal function, and by triggering other events that weaken a person's immune function. For example, the network of signaling molecules that normally regulates a person's immune response is disrupted during HIV disease, impairing a person's ability to fight other infections. The HIV-mediated destruction of the lymph nodes and related immunologic organs also plays a major role in causing the immunosuppression seen in people with AIDS"

    "span_summary": "HIV is not transmitted through saliva. Transmission occurs through blood and sexual intercourse. The main causes of HIV/AIDS include sex with other men (57.5% for adult males), injecting drugs (24% for adult males, 38% for adult females), and heterosexual contact (9.5% for adult males, 59% for adult females). HIV disease weakens the immune system by destroying CD4+ T cells, making individuals susceptible to infections and cancers. AIDS, the end stage of HIV, is characterized by severe health complications such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological issues, and specific cancers like Kaposi's sarcoma. HIV likely induces AIDS by directly harming CD4+ T cells, disrupting immune response signaling, and damaging lymph nodes and immune organs."

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children and teenagers not be given aspirin or medicine containing aspirin when they have any viral illness such as the common cold."
    ],
    "span_summary": "For the common cold, there is no cure, but relief from symptoms can be achieved through various measures. These include resting in bed, staying hydrated with plenty of fluids, and addressing specific symptoms such as a scratchy or sore throat by gargling with warm salt water or using throat sprays or lozenges. For a raw nose, using petroleum jelly is recommended. Headache or fever can be alleviated with aspirin or acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol), although caution is advised regarding aspirin use in children recovering from flu or chickenpox due to the potential link to Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a rare but serious illness that predominantly affects children aged 3 to 12 and can lead to permanent brain damage or death. As a precaution, the American Academy of Pediatrics advises against giving aspirin or aspirin-containing medications to children and teenagers during any viral illness, including the common cold."

      "The word \"fart\" can stand for: Frequency Actuated Rectal Tremor. Farting, also known as flatulence, is the act of passing intestinal gas from the butt. Intestinal gas comes from several sources: air we swallow, gas that seeps into our intestines from our blood, gas produced by chemical reactions in our guts, and gas produced by bacteria living in our guts. Burps are not farts that come out your mouth. They have to do with your stomach",
      ": The feces is decaying, and thus gives off gas, when enough gas is built up, it come out",
      "Well, for starters, the gas that makes up a fart comes from two sources: more originates from the breakdown of food by the digestive system, and some is from swallowed air. In the first case, foodstuffs are broken down by enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria in order for the energy in them to be made available to the body. Through the processes of digestion and fermentation, gases can be liberated from what's eaten. In the second case, air that a person swallows from eating, drinking, breathing, chewing gum, and being stressed, among other ways of entry, that's not expelled during a burp travels through the stomach and intestine, transforming into fart-ready mode. In either case, the gases flow down through the rest of the digestive tract and eventually exit the body - Poof! Ping! Pfft! Toot-toot! Kaboom! - expelled as a fart, or farts. And this silent or noisy expulsion of air can help bring about some relief and comfort from a buildup of gas within the lower part of the body"

The gas results from various sources, including the breakdown of food by digestive processes and the swallowing of air. Enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria contribute to the release of gases during digestion. Additionally, swallowed air, accumulated through activities like eating, drinking, and stress, can transform into farts as it travels through the digestive tract. Farting is a natural bodily function that provides relief from gas buildup in the lower digestive system. The humorous acronym \"Frequency Actuated Rectal Tremor\" offers a lighthearted perspective on this common phenomenon."

Boosters of the vaccine are recommended for adults because the benefits of the vaccine decrease with age; they are particularly recommended for those travelling to areas where the disease has not been eradicated yet.Signs and symptomsThe respiratory form has an incubation time of 1-4 days. Symptoms include fatigue, fever, a mild sore throat and problems swallowing. Children infected have symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, chills, and a high fever, although some do not show symptoms until the infection has progressed further.Low blood pressure may develop in some patients.

      "All tea comes from the same plant--black, green, and oolong teas all have the same parents. The difference in the teas lies in how the teas are prepared after picking. Black and oolong tea are fermented, but Green tea is not. Therefore the active constituents remain unaltered in green tea. The most important ingredient in green tea is the phytonutrient eppigallocatchin or EGCG for short. This substance is a polyphenolic compound that acts as an antioxidant.What does EGCG do?Research has shown that these polyphenolic antioxidants protects the body against cardiovascular disease, and promote a healthy immune system. However in this new research, Professor Roger Thornley in England states, “We have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme DHFR or dihydrofolate which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs. This is the first time to our knowledge a known target for an anti-cancer drug has been identified as being inhibited by EGCG.” The scientist continued by saying that EGCG is probably just one of a number of anti-cancer mechanisms in green tea.It's also said to help reduce bad Cholestrol among many other help benefits which are still being researched. You will find several books and online claims about green tea - most of them are true but not all of them have been published in scientific journals yet because enough research has not been done yet.In short - it's good for you!",
      "as oppossed to coffee, green tea has an alkalizing affect on the body whereas coffee is acidic. our typical diet is all ready too acidic. just about anything green/fruits/vegetables  helps us this way. Green tea also has a lot of antioxidants"

    "span_summary": "For information purposes, all types of tea, be it black, green, or oolong, originate from the same plant, with variations arising from post-harvest processing. Unlike black and oolong teas, green tea is not fermented, preserving its active constituents, notably the polyphenolic antioxidant EGCG. Research suggests that EGCG in green tea contributes to cardiovascular health, boosts the immune system, and may inhibit the enzyme DHFR, a target for anti-cancer drugs. Despite numerous claims about green tea's health benefits, not all are scientifically substantiated due to ongoing research. In general, green tea is lauded for reducing bad cholesterol, offering an alkalizing effect on the body, in contrast to coffee's acidity, and providing a rich source of antioxidants."

Physical and chemical properties:Aflatoxins are potent toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunosuppressive agents, produced as secondary metabolites by the fungus Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus on variety of food products. Among 18 different types of aflatoxins identified, major members are aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is normally predominant in amount in cultures as well as in food products. Pure AFB1 is pale-white to yellow crystalline, odorless solid. Aflatoxins are soluble in methanol, chloroform, actone, acetonitrile. A. flavus typically produces AFB1 and AFB2, where as A. parasiticus produce AFG1 and AFG2 as well as AFB1 and AFB2. Four other aflatoxins M1, M2, B2A, G2A which may be produced in minor amounts were subsequently isolated from cultures of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A number of closely related compounds namely aflatoxin GM1, parasiticol and aflatoxicol are also produced by A. flavus. Aflatoxin M1and M2 are major metabolites of aflatoxin B1 and B2 respectively, found in milk of animals that have consumed feed contaminated with aflatoxins",

      "Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). Multiple sclerosis (MS) usually affects woman more than men. The disorder most commonly begins between ages 20 and 40, but can strike at any age.The exact cause is not known, but MS is believed to result from damage to the myelin sheath, the protective material which surrounds nerve cells. It is a progressive disease, meaning the damage gets worse over time. Inflammation destroys the myelin, leaving multiple areas of scar tissue (sclerosis). The inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system.The inflammation causes nerve impulses to slow down or become blocked, leading to the symptoms of MS. Repeated episodes, or flare ups, of inflammation can occur along any area of the brain and spinal cord.Symptoms vary because the location and extent of each attack varies. Usually episodes that last days, weeks, or months alternate with times of reduced or no symptoms (remission).Recurrence (relapse) is common although non-stop progression without periods of remission may also occur.Researchers are not sure what triggers an attack. Patients with MS typically have a higher number of immune cells than a healthy person, which suggests that an immune response might play a role. The most common theories point to a virus or genetic defect, or a combination of both. There also appears to be a genetic link to the disease. MS is more likely to occur in northern Europe, the northern United States, southern Australia, and New Zealand than in other areas. Geographic studies indicate there may be an environmental factor involved.People with a family history of MS and those who live in a geographical area with a higher incidence rate for MS have a higher risk of the disease.Check out this article with excellent illustrations:http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000737.htm",
      "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease of the Central Nervous System (CNS) - that's the brain and spinal cord. Predominantly, it is a disease of the \"white matter\" tissue.

      "Thirst and drinking function to maintain body water balance and are basic to survival. Thirst is often associated with a dry unpleasant-tasting mouth and the feeling of a need to obtain water; it can result from dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, pharmacologic agents, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids. Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid. Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers. Although nurses are commonly confronted with client complaints of thirst, there has been minimal nursing research that relates to assessment of thirst and drinking behaviors, nursing diagnoses for thirst, or nursing interventions for persons with altered thirst or drinking behaviors.Thirst is the sensation indicating the body's need for water. Dry or salty food and dry, dusty air may induce such a sensation by depleting moisture in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Relief through ingestion of water is only temporary, however, if thirst results from a generalized depletion of water in the system. About three fourths of the body is composed of fluids, and the average adult requires 21/2 qt (2.4 liters) of fluid per day, supplied by water, other beverages, and foods. Depriving the body of water interferes with its metabolism and functions, causing dehydration, which is eventually fatal. The unnatural thirst that accompanies fever, diabetes, and other disorders is caused by a rapid reduction of the body fluids. The sensation of thirst is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus in the brain. Dehydration of the cells triggers the posterior pituitary to releast the antidiuretic hormone (ADH",
