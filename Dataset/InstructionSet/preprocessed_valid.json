However, a common theme emerges that people tend to get used to the discomfort over time. The pain is often associated with tightness, difficulty eating, and potential challenges in speaking initially. Some mention the use of wax to alleviate pain caused by friction with brackets. Despite the initial challenges, many report adapting quickly and experiencing less discomfort as time goes on. The experiences also highlight that age, the specific treatment plan, and the severity of the dental issues can influence the level of discomfort. Ultimately, several individuals express that the pain diminishes over time, and they become accustomed to having braces."

      "Many children are born with JAUNDICE.  When the baby was in the womb, the mother's liver took care of the excess pigment (called bilirubin) in the blood that causes jaundice. It takes a while for the baby's liver to be able to process and eliminate it. Mild cases can be treated by exposing baby briefly to sunlight and making sure baby is getting plenty of fluids (breastmilk is best).  More severe cases can be treated by your pediatrician using special light therapy.",
      "What is jaundice? Jaundice is an illness that can happen in the first few days of a baby's life. It turns your baby's skin, eyes and mouth a yellow color. The yellow color is caused by bilirubin.Bilirubin is made when the body breaks down old red blood cells. This is a normal process that happens all through life. Bilirubin goes to the liver, where it is changed again. Then it goes into the intestines and the kidneys, and then it goes out of the body. If too much bilirubin builds up in your baby's body, it makes a yellow color called jaundice (say: \"john-diss\").Jaundice is common in babies and is usually not serious.Why do some babies get jaundice? Red blood cells have a shorter life in babies than they do in adults. This means more bilirubin goes through your baby's liver. If your baby's skin is bruised during birth, more red cells may need to be broken down. Then your baby's liver has to handle even more bilirubin. Sometimes a baby's liver is not mature enough to handle the extra bilirubin.How can I tell if my baby has jaundice?",
      "If your baby has pale skin, it should look white when you gently press it with your fingertips. If the skin looks yellow, your baby may have jaundice. If your baby has darker skin, it may be harder to check, except by looking at your baby's eyes and inside your baby's mouth.Artificial light, especially fluorescent lights, can sometimes fool your eyes into seeing a yellow color that is not really there.",
      "As the amount of bilirubin in the blood increases, your baby's body will get more yellow. As the bilirubin level rises, the yellow color can move from your baby's head down to the chest and even down to the toes.If your baby's skin is yellow, see your baby's doctor right away. The doctor will take a small amount of your baby's blood and measure the bilirubin in it.How is jaundice treated? If the bilirubin level is not too high, your baby might not need any treatment. Your doctor might just want you to feed your baby breast milk or formula more often.If the bilirubin level is very high or is getting higher very quickly, your baby will need light therapy. This is also called phototherapy. Phototherapy helps to break down bilirubin in your baby's skin.For this treatment, your baby is placed under special white, blue or green lights. The baby might also be placed on a special light-producing blanket. Your baby's eyes are covered to protect them from the bright lights. Phototherapy usually lasts for 1 or 2 days.Phototherapy can give your baby loose stools, temperature problems or dehydration. Your doctor will watch your baby carefully to prevent or treat these problems.If your baby's bilirubin level gets too high, and phototherapy does not work well enough, the baby might need an exchange transfusion. In this treatment, some of your baby's blood is taken out, and it is replaced with blood from someone else.Can jaundice hurt my baby? Jaundice is not a serious problem in most healthy babies. However, very high bilirubin levels can be dangerous. It can give some babies brain damage.Your doctor will measure your baby's bilirubin level a number of times. If necessary, your baby will be treated. This usually keeps the bilirubin level from getting high enough to hurt your baby. How long will my baby have jaundice? Jaundice lasts for a different time in different babies. Often, the bilirubin level goes up for the first 3 to 4 days and then slowly goes back down. A baby who is breastfed may have mild jaundice for a longer time than a baby who is formula-fed"

Bilirubin is produced when the body breaks down old red blood cells, and its accumulation leads to jaundice.

Jaundice is usually not serious, but very high bilirubin levels can be dangerous, potentially causing brain damage. Monitoring bilirubin levels and appropriate treatment help prevent complications. The duration of jaundice varies among babies, with breastfed infants possibly experiencing it for a longer time compared to formula-fed babies. Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider ensures timely intervention if needed."

The impact of vaccines, including the tetanus vaccine, has been substantial in reducing the incidence of such diseases.

      ": Understand it as well as possible and then be supportive of treatments. This FAQ's might help you.1. What is bipolar disorder? Bipolar disorder is a common, recurrent, severe psychiatric illness that affects an individual's mood, behavior and ability to think clearly. It occurs in 1% to 2% of the population in the United States. A variant, called bipolar II disorder, is probably even more common and occurs in up to 3% of the general population in this country. 2. What are the differences between bipolar I and bipolar II disorders? Bipolar I disorder is characterized by episodes of mania that alternate with periods of depression or periods in which individuals have simultaneously occurring manic and depressive symptoms called mixed states. In contrast, bipolar II disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and milder symptoms of mania, called hypomania. Hypomanic episodes typically do not impair an individual's ability to function to the extent that full-blown manic episodes do additionally; hypomanic episodes are not complicated by psychotic symptoms. 3. What is rapid cycling? The term rapid cycling was originally coined by David Dunner, M.D., and Ron Fieve, M.D., in the 1970s when they identified a group of individuals who did not respond well to lithium. These patients typically had four or more episodes of mania or depression in the 12-month interval prior to lithium treatment. This definition has been adopted formally by DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed.) and specifically means the occurrence of four or more mood episodes within the preceding year. In severe cases, rapid cycling can occur even within a one-day period. 4. At what age does bipolar disorder appear? Bipolar disorder most commonly presents in the late teens and early 20s. Unfortunately, for most individuals, lifelong treatment may be required to prevent recurrent manic and depressive episodes. Equally unfortunate is evidence that the illness often goes undiagnosed and untreated for many years; the longer the illness progresses without treatment, the greater the impairment in an individual's psychological, educational and vocational development. Additionally, untreated bipolar disorder carries a high risk of suicide. 5. Is bipolar disorder genetic? Bipolar disorder, among all psychiatric illnesses, may have the greatest genetic contribution. For instance, if an individual has a parent with bipolar disorder, the chance that the individual's child will have bipolar disorder is about nine-fold greater than in the general population, with the risk rising from about 1% to about 10%. The inheritability of this illness is estimated to be anywhere from 50% to 80%. On the other hand, if a person with bipolar disorder is thinking about having children, there are still good odds that the child will not have bipolar illness. So the genetic determinants of the illness are complicated. 6. How is bipolar disorder treated? The cornerstone of treatment is medications that treat acute manic, depressive or mixed episodes, and which, in the long run, attempt to prevent the recurrence of these episodes. Such medications include lithium, divalproex (Depakote) and, more recently, some of the atypical antipsychotics as well as antidepressants. Psychotherapy plays an important role in improving the course and outcome of this illness in people. In particular, those with bipolar disorder often have strained relationships with loved ones because of their experiences during manic or depressive episodes; psychotherapy can help repair these torn relationships. In addition, psychotherapy can educate people about the signs and symptoms of their illness, how to pay attention to warning signs and how to nip emerging episodes in the bud. Psychotherapy can also help individuals cope with the stress that can sometimes precipitate manic or depressive episodes. 7. What med",

With a variant known as Bipolar II disorder impacting up to 3%, this illness manifests as manic episodes alternating with depression in Bipolar I and as recurrent depressive episodes with milder hypomanic states in Bipolar II. Rapid cycling, involving four or more mood episodes within a year, adds complexity to the disorder. Onset typically occurs in late teens or early 20s, and genetic factors contribute significantly. Treatment involves medications for acute episodes and long-term prevention, along with psychotherapy to enhance coping strategies and relationship dynamics. Friends and family can offer valuable support by understanding the condition and actively participating in the individual's treatment journey."

It is emphasized that using protection is the safest approach to prevent unintended pregnancies."

      "Diphtheria is an upper respiratory tract illness characterized by sore throat, low-grade fever, and an adherent membrane of the tonsil(s), pharynx, and/or nose. A milder form of diphtheria can be limited to the skin. It is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, an aerobic Gram-positive bacterium.Diphtheria is a highly contagious disease spread by direct physical contact or breathing the secretions of those infected. Diphtheria was once quite common, but has now largely been eradicated in developed nations (in the United States for instance, there have been fewer than 5 cases a year reported since 1980, as the DPT (Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis) vaccine is given to all school children). Boosters of the vaccine are recommended for adults because the benefits of the vaccine decrease with age; they are particularly recommended for those travelling to areas where the disease has not been eradicated yet.Signs and symptomsThe respiratory form has an incubation time of 1-4 days. Symptoms include fatigue, fever, a mild sore throat and problems swallowing. Children infected have symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, chills, and a high fever, although some do not show symptoms until the infection has progressed further.Low blood pressure may develop in some patients. Longer-term effects include cardiomyopathy and peripheral neuropathy (sensory type)[1]",

    "question": "what is Fifth Disease?",
    "perspective": "INFORMATION",
    "spans": [
      "What is \"fifth disease?\"Fifth disease is a mild rash illness that occurs most commonly in children. The ill child typically has a \"slapped-cheek\" rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a \"cold\" a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days.What causes fifth disease?Fifth disease is caused by infection with human parvovirus B19. This virus infects only humans. Pet dogs or cats may be immunized against \"parvovirus,\" but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. Therefore, a child cannot \"catch\" parvovirus from a pet dog or cat, and a pet cat or dog cannot catch human parvovirus B19 from an ill child.Can adults get fifth disease?Yes, they can. An adult who is not immune can be infected with parvovirus B19 and either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease, joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the body are affected. The joints most frequently affected are the hands, wrists, and knees. The joint pain and swelling usually resolve in a week or two, but they may last several months. About 50% of adults, however, have been previously infected with parvovirus B19, have developed immunity to the virus, and cannot get fifth disease.Is fifth disease contagious?Yes. A person infected with parvovirus B19 is contagious during the early part of the illness, before the rash appears. By the time a child has the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash of fifth disease, for example, he or she is probably no longer contagious and may return to school or child care center. This contagious period is different than that for many other rash illnesses, such as measles, for which the child is contagious while he or she has the rash.How does someone get infected with parvovirus B19?Parvovirus B19 has been found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of infected persons before the onset of rash, when they appear to \"just have a cold.\" The virus is probably spread from person to person by direct contact with those secretions, such as sharing drinking cups or utensils. In a household, as many as 50% of susceptible persons exposed to a family member who has fifth disease may become infected. During school outbreaks, 10% to 60% of students may get fifth disease.How soon after infection with parvovirus B19 does a person become ill?A susceptible person usually becomes ill 4 to 14 days after being infected with the virus, but may become ill for as long as 20 days after infection.Does everyone who is infected with parvovirus B19 become ill?No. During outbreaks of fifth disease, about 20% of adults and children who are infected with parvovirus B19 do not develop any symptoms. Furthermore, other persons infected with the virus will have a non-specific illness that is not characteristic of fifth disease. Persons infected with the virus, however, do develop lasting immunity that protects them against infection in the future.How is fifth disease diagnosed?A physician can often diagnose fifth disease by seeing the typical rash during a physical examination. In cases in which it is important to confirm the diagnosis, a blood test may be done to look for antibodies to parvovirus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to parvovirus B19 and other germs. If immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to parvovirus B19 is detected, the test result suggests that the person has had a recent infection.Is fifth disease serious?Fifth disease is usually a mild illness that resolves on its own among children and adults who are otherwise healthy. Joint pain and swelling in adults usually resolve without long-term disability.Parvovirus B19 infection may cause a seriou",

      "hiccup or hiccough (generally pronounced \"hiccup\" independent of the spelling) is an involuntary spasm of the diaphragm; typically this repeats several times a minute. The sudden rush of air into the lungs causes the glottis to close, creating the \"hic\" noise. A bout of hiccups generally resolves by itself, although many home remedies are in circulation to shorten the duration, and medication is occasionally necessary. By extension, the term \"hiccup\" is also used to describe a small and unrepeated aberration in an otherwise consistent pattern. The medical term is singultus.While many cases develop spontaneously, hiccups are known to develop often in specific situations, such as eating too quickly, taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal, eating very hot or spicy food, laughing vigorously or coughing, or drinking an excess of an alcoholic beverage. Hiccups may be caused by pressure to the phrenic nerve by other anatomical structures, or rarely by tumors.",

The term \"hiccup\" is also metaphorically used to describe minor deviations in an otherwise consistent pattern. These spasms can be triggered by diverse factors such as eating too quickly, consuming hot or spicy foods, laughing vigorously, or drinking excessively. Hiccups may also arise from anatomical pressure on the phrenic nerve or, rarely, due to tumors. Irritation to the diaphragm, a muscle aiding in breathing, is the underlying cause of hiccups.

The antioxidants help your body fight against free radicals, which can mutate cells and make you sick. Numerous scientific discoveries have also linked green tea with remarkable disease preventative properties. Gargling with green tea has been shown to inactivate the flu virus, as has drinking a cup each day to activate the polyphenols (powerful antioxidants) that are also suspected to work well against both the cold and flu viri. As China permits greater access to its interior to scientists, reports grow of entire villages in the green tea growing regions where cancers and sicknesses are statistically lower than the national norm.

They may also occur during pregnancy. Such murmurs are called \"innocent\" heart murmurs. They are not associated with medical or heart conditions, and do not require treatment or lifestyle changes.Though many murmurs are innocent, some may indicate serious heart problems. For instance, heart murmurs may be caused by blood flowing through a heart valve made leaky or narrow by disease. Murmurs can also be caused by increased blood flow across a valve as a result of medical conditions such as anemia or hypothyroidism. Congenital cardiac defects (heart problems present at birth) can also cause heart murmurs. These often can be repaired with surgery.Within the heart there are four chambers separated from each other by valves, or flaps, that regulate how much blood enters each chamber at any time. Healthy valves also help prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction in your heart.A healthy heart makes a \"lub-dub\" sound as it beats. The \"lub\" (systolic sound) happens when part of the heart contracts and the mitral and tricuspid valves close, and the \"dub\" (diastolic sound) occurs when part of the heart relaxes and the aortic and pulmonic valves close. A heart murmur is an extra sound, such as a whooshing, in the heartbeat caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves.Heart murmurs can be heard through a stethoscope and often are detected during routine physical examinations. On further examination, your doctor may find that the heart murmur is innocent. If your heart murmur is related to more serious heart problems, your doctor may refer you to a cardiologist (heart specialist). Medication or surgery may be recommended to treat the underlying problem. He or she may also suggest that you take extra precautions against getting a heart infection, such as by taking antibiotics when you have dental work or some surgeries. With thorough examination and proper tests, your doctor should be able to tell what causes your heart murmur.SymptomsMany people with heart murmurs experience no symptoms. However, some murmurs can occur in conjunction with these other symptoms:    * Chest pain    * Rapid heartbeat (palpitations)    * Breathlessness    * Fatigue    * Bluish skin color or fingertips (sometimes seen in babies with congenital heart defects",

Many people, including healthy children and pregnant individuals, may have \"innocent\" heart murmurs that do not require treatment. Some heart murmurs, however, can indicate serious heart problems, such as valve issues or congenital defects. The heart murmur is an extra sound, like a whooshing, caused by irregular blood flow through the heart valves. It can be detected during routine physical examinations and, if necessary, further examination by a cardiologist. Symptoms may include chest pain, rapid heartbeat, breathlessness, fatigue, and bluish skin color in some cases. A heart murmur could also be associated with a hole in the heart. Thorough examination and appropriate tests help determine the cause of the heart murmur, and treatment may involve medication, surgery, or precautions against infections. The sound of a heart murmur is distinct from normal heart sounds and is audible through a stethoscope."

      "There is no cure for endometriosis. But there are many treatments, each of which has pros and cons. It is important to build a good relationship with your doctor, so you can decide what option is best for you. Pain Medication For some women with mild symptoms, no further treatment other than medication for pain may be needed. For women with minimal endometriosis who want to become pregnant, doctors are saying that, depending on the age of the woman and her amount of pain from the disease, the best thing to do is to have a trial period of unprotected sex for six months to one year. If she does not get pregnant in that time, then further treatment may be needed. Hormone Treatment For patients who do not wish to become pregnant, but need treatment for their disease, their doctors may suggest hormone treatment. Hormone treatment is most effective when growths are small. Hormones can come in pill form, by shot or injection, or in a nasal spray. There are several hormones used for this treatment including a combination of estrogen and progestin such as birth control pills, a progestin alone, Danocrine (a weak male hormone), and GnRH agonists (gonadotropin releasing hormone). Birth control pills control the growth of the tissue that lines the uterus and often decrease the amount of menstrual flow. They usually contain two hormones, estrogen and progestin. Once a woman stops taking them, the ability to become pregnant returns, but the symptoms of endometriosis also may return. Some women take birth control pills continuously, without using the sugar pills that signal the body to go through menstruation. When birth control pills are taken in this way, the menstrual period may stop altogether, which can reduce pain or get rid of it entirely. Some birth control pills contain only progestin, a progesterone-like hormone. Women who can't take estrogen use these pills to reduce menstrual flow. With these pills, some women may not have pain for several years after stopping treatment. All birth control pills might cause some mild side effects like weight gain, bleeding between periods, and bloating. Danocrine has become a more common treatment choice than either progestin or combination hormone pills. Side effects with Danocrine include oily skin, pimples or acne, weight gain, muscle cramps, tiredness, smaller breasts, breast tenderness, headaches, dizziness, weakness, hot flashes, or a deepening of the voice. Women on Danocrine probably will only get a period now and then, or might not get it at all. Women who take Danocrine also should take steps to prevent pregnancy because it can harm a baby growing in the uterus. Because other hormones, like birth control pills, should be avoided, health care providers recommend that you use condoms, a diaphragm, or other \"barrier\" methods to prevent pregnancy. GnRH agonists (used daily in a nose spray, or as an injection given once a month or every three months) prevent the body from making certain hormones to prevent menstruation. Without menstruation, the growth of endometriosis is slowed or stopped. These medications can cause side effects, such as hot flashes, tiredness, problems sleeping, headaches, depression, bone loss, and vaginal dryness. Most health care providers recommend that a woman stay on a GnRH agonist for about six months. After that time, the body will start having a period again and a woman could get pregnant. But, after that time, about half of women have some return of their endometriosis symptoms. Surgery Surgery is usually the best choice for women with extensive endometriosis, or those with severe pain. There are both minor and major surgeries that can help.

Building a strong doctor-patient relationship is essential for deciding the most suitable option. Pain medication may be sufficient for those with mild symptoms, while women with minimal endometriosis aspiring to become pregnant might opt for a trial period of unprotected sex. Hormone treatments, including birth control pills, progestin, Danocrine, or GnRH agonists, are suggested for those not aiming for pregnancy, but their effectiveness varies. Surgery, such as laparoscopy, is recommended for extensive or severe cases. Hysterectomy may be considered in severe cases when other treatments fail and fertility is no longer desired. The choice of treatment is highly individual, necessitating collaborative decision-making between the patient and her doctor, as there is no one-size-fits-all solution. It's important to note that pregnancy does not universally cure endometriosis, and various treatments should be explored based on individual circumstances and preferences."

      ": Gynaecology is a typically a consultant specialty. In most countries, women must see a general practitioner first. If their condition requires knowledge or equipment unavailable to the GP, they are referred to a gynaecologist. However, in the United States, law and many health insurance plans allow gynaecologists to provide primary care, and some women select that option.As in all of medicine, the main tools of diagnosis are clinical history and examination. Gynaecological examination is special in that it is quite intimate, and that it involves special equipment -- the speculum. The speculum consists of two hinged blades of flat metal, which are used to open the vagina, to permit examination of the cervix uteri. Gynaecologists may also do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen, two fingers in the vagina), to palpate the uterus and ovaries. They may occasionally do a rectal exam. Male gynaecologists often have a female chaperone (nurse or medical student) for their examination. Virgins are not usually examined vaginally. An abdominal ultrasound is used normally to confirm the bimanual examination.InvestigationsSome of the investigations used in gynaecology are:abdominal ultrasound, to give a low-power view of the pelvic organs. vaginal ultrasound. A probe is passed into the vagina, which allows a detailed view of the uterus and its contents. blood tests. Levels of hormones such as estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and progesterone are measured, as well as prolactin. hysteroscopy -- a fine tube is passed into the uterus via the cervix under a general anaesthetic. laparoscopy -- tubes are passed into the peritoneal cavity, which is then insufflated with carbon dioxide. This is commonly used to diagnose endometriosis. MRI and CT scans are rarely used, apart from tumor staging in gynecological cancer. Pelvic X-ray is rare. It can be used to delineate the uterine cavity with an injected dye (hysterosalpingogram) and to measure the pelvic girdle.DiseasesThe main conditions dealt with by a gynaecologist are:cancer of the cervix. The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear is a means of detecting this, by obtaining a sample of cervical epithelial cells and examining them under a microscope for malignant changes. All women are encouraged to have pap smears at regular intervals after commencing intercourse. incontinence of urine. amenorrhoea (absent periods) dysmenorrhoea (painful periods) infertility menorrhagia (heavy periods). This is a main indication for hysterectomy. prolapse Obviously there is some crossover in these areas. Amenorrhoea in a young girl may be referred to a paediatrician, incontinence to a urologist",

There are complicated reasons other than that related to an individual's desire to transition.  Transsexuals can be heterosexual, gay, lesbian, bisexual, or any other sexuality.

Both male-to-female and female-to-male transexuals exist, but MTF is more common.It takes hormone therapy and surgery to completely change one's sex.  People who choose to undergo the transistion are often required to live with their new identity for a year before doctors will allow any surgery to be done.  People who have not had the surgery are called pre-op transexuals, as opposed to post-op.Transexuality actually has nothing to do with who the person is sexually attracted to, only the sexual identity of the person.  This is probably the hardest thing to grasp for non-transexuals as our sexual preference is the most over-riding part of our sexuality.  What Dr. Dee refers to is a pre-op transexual.  They normally can't \"play a man\", as the breast tissue has already increased to a size that would require disguise to revert back.

The infection affects men and women differently. In women, untreated chlamydia can spread to the pelvic area, infecting the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). This may result in permanent damage to reproductive organs, leading to infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. Pregnant women with chlamydia are at risk of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage). In men, untreated chlamydia can impact the testicles and potentially lead to infertility. Additionally, some individuals suggest a potential link between chlamydia and sterilization, while others express concerns about its association with blindness."

      "HIV is the virus that may causes AIDS. HIV belongs to a subset of viruses called retroviruses or slow virus.  This is because it is a progressive disease. HIV is entered through the body through the mucous membranes or thru blood to blood contact. Once you get the virus it slowly begins to attack the immune system, killing off healthy immune system cells. The deterioration and destruction of immune function leads to AIDS. AIDS is the final stage of the HIV infection. A person is said to have AIDS when the cd4 counts drops below 200 and or a person has 1 or more opportunistic infections. The OIs, as they are called, are normal infections that a healthy person would be able to fight off. The four stages of the HIV infection are as follows: 1) The period following infection is called the window. It is called this because it reflect the window of time between infection and that which antibodies are devlop in a person. The HIV test looks for antibodies not the virus. 2) The second stage is called seroconversion. This is when the body begins to develop lots of antibodies to fight off the virus in the body. During this period a person may have flu like sympton. Also during this period is said to be very infectious. 3) The third stage is called symptom free. During this period a person may have no sympton what so ever. This can last any where from 6 months to well over ten years. The medical world is not sure why some people are living sympton free for so long. 4) The final stage is called AIDS. This is the period when TCELL drop to below 200 and the OI\"S are present. So, as we see, HIV is a infection that will leads to AIDS. The body immune system is slowly being attacked until it is destroyed and can't fight off infections. Once this happens a person is said to have AIDS. AIDS is the final stage",
      "AIDS (Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome) is a fatal disease caused by a rapidly mutating retrovirus (HIV) that attacks the immune system and leaves the victim vulnerable to infections, malignancies, and neurological disorders.HIV or Human Immunodeficiency Virus is a retrovirus that causes AIDS by affecting the very immune system cells (T4 lymphocytes) that would ordinarily fight off such a viral infection. HIV is not transmitted by casual contact; transmission requires a direct exchange of body fluids, such as blood or blood products, breast milk, semen, or vaginal secretions, most commonly as a result of sexual activity or the sharing of needles among drug users. Such a transmission may also occur from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth. Saliva, tears, urine, feces, and sweat do not appear to transmit the virus",
      "AIDS expands to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome is a state of advanced stage of HIV infection. HIV expands to Human Immunodeficiency Virus and is the virus that causes AIDS.The term AIDS first appeared in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), USA in 1982 to describe \". . . a disease, at least moderately predictive of a defect in cell-mediated immunity, occurring with no known cause for diminished resistance to that disease\" The first cases of AIDS were identified in the United States in 1981, but it most likely existed here and in other parts of the world for many years before that. In 1984 scientists proved that HIV causes AIDS"

It's important to note that HIV is a virus, and AIDS is the advanced stage of the disease that occurs as the immune system is progressively compromised. The transmission of HIV requires direct exchange of certain body fluids, and it is not transmitted through casual contact. The term AIDS was first used in 1982 to describe a disease associated with a defect in cell-mediated immunity. The link between HIV and AIDS was scientifically established in 1984."

In the first case, foodstuffs are broken down by enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria in order for the energy in them to be made available to the body. Through the processes of digestion and fermentation, gases can be liberated from what's eaten. In the second case, air that a person swallows from eating, drinking, breathing, chewing gum, and being stressed, among other ways of entry, that's not expelled during a burp travels through the stomach and intestine, transforming into fart-ready mode. In either case, the gases flow down through the rest of the digestive tract and eventually exit the body - Poof! Ping! Pfft! Toot-toot! Kaboom! - expelled as a fart, or farts. And this silent or noisy expulsion of air can help bring about some relief and comfort from a buildup of gas within the lower part of the body"

Most notably, crucial immune cells called CD4+ T cells are disabled and killed during the typical course of infection. These cells, sometimes called \"T-helper cells,\" play a central role in the immune response, signaling other cells in the immune system to perform their special functions. A healthy, uninfected person usually has 800 to 1,200 CD4+ T cells per cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood. During HIV infection, the number of these cells in a person's blood progressively declines. When a person's CD4+ T cell count falls below 200/mm3, he or she becomes particularly vulnerable to the opportunistic infections and cancers that typify AIDS, the end stage of HIV disease. People with AIDS often suffer infections of the lungs, intestinal tract, brain, eyes and other organs, as well as debilitating weight loss, diarrhea, neurologic conditions and cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma and certain types of lymphomas. Most scientists think that HIV causes AIDS by directly inducing the death of CD4+ T cells or interfering with their normal function, and by triggering other events that weaken a person's immune function. For example, the network of signaling molecules that normally regulates a person's immune response is disrupted during HIV disease, impairing a person's ability to fight other infections. The HIV-mediated destruction of the lymph nodes and related immunologic organs also plays a major role in causing the immunosuppression seen in people with AIDS"

The main causes of HIV/AIDS include sex with other men (57.5% for adult males), injecting drugs (24% for adult males, 38% for adult females), and heterosexual contact (9.5% for adult males, 59% for adult females). HIV disease weakens the immune system by destroying CD4+ T cells, making individuals susceptible to infections and cancers. AIDS, the end stage of HIV, is characterized by severe health complications such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological issues, and specific cancers like Kaposi's sarcoma. HIV likely induces AIDS by directly harming CD4+ T cells, disrupting immune response signaling, and damaging lymph nodes and immune organs."

      "Working out the same muscle group every day just makes the muscle larger or blukier. Tissue are packed into highly arranged bundles. When you work out you are actually contracting and relaxing the tissue that makes up the muscle. As you move your muscle some of the tissue break down causing the pain and friction. Resting a day between working out just gives time for the muscle to repair the broken down tissue. The benefit is that since some of the tissue had broken down when you work out the next day you rely on other tissue  that has not broken down in the muscle group to raise the weight that you are raising. The muscle will eventually get bulkier if you do it that way and it will be pretty painful because the tissue will eventually be broken down. Doctors don't usually recommend you to work out the same muscle group every day because they believe that the muscle should be fully repaired before you work out",

Hard Day was warm-up followed by multiple mile run, workout in the gym, whatever.  They feel that it is required.As for the muscle burn, that happens because you are burning the muscle and fat, to my understanding.  Depending on whether you are trying to build-up your muscles, gain tone, or lose weight, you will get different effects for different types of workout",

    ],
    "span_summary": "Working out the same muscle group every day can lead to muscle enlargement or bulkiness as tissues are densely packed in organized bundles. During exercise, the muscle tissues contract and relax, causing some breakdown and resulting in pain and friction. Resting a day between workouts allows for the repair of the broken-down tissues. This rest is essential as it forces reliance on unaffected tissues in the muscle group during subsequent workouts, contributing to muscle development. Doctors typically advise against daily workouts for the same muscle group, emphasizing the need for full muscle recovery before exercising again. In the military, the practice of alternating between Easy Days and Hard Days is common, allowing for adequate recovery. Muscle burn during exercise is believed to be a result of burning both muscle and fat, with different workout types producing varied effects on muscle building, toning, or weight loss. Rotating muscle groups in workouts is recommended to prevent the body from adapting to a routine, promoting effective fat burning and muscle development. Feeling a burn during exercise is considered normal, indicating that the workout is targeting the muscles correctly. It's advised to rotate exercises to avoid becoming 'muscle heavy' in one area and to allow muscles to heal and grow effectively. Simply working the same muscles every day can lead to damage without maximizing the benefits that come from rest and recovery."

The idea behind the intense workout routine is to enhance calorie expenditure and potentially promote muscle development. However, it's important to note that rest and recovery periods are crucial for muscle repair, and overtraining without adequate recovery can lead to fatigue, injury, and diminished results. Listening to the body's signals, including the absence of the burn, is essential for a balanced and sustainable fitness routine.

A treatment session lasts about an hour; the practitioner directs reike energy through his hands to the patient.  The patient lies clothed on a treatment table and the practitioner holds his hands on or over the body in 12 basic positions for about five minutes each.  This is said to balance the body's energy centers or \"chakras.\"  Some patients may feel relaxed after treatment; others feel invigorated.\"To get in touch with your own energy body as a beginner, I recommend T'ai Chi.

Strabismus can be constant (meaning the eyes are always crossed or misaligned) or intermittent (meaning it happens now and then).What is amblyopia?Amblyopia (also called lazy eye) develops when the brain shuts off or suppresses vision in one eye. This can happen if your baby's eyes are misaligned or if he can't see as well with one eye because of nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, or something that's blocking clear vision in that eye, like a cataract or a drooping eyelid.About 3 to 6 percent of children under the age of 6 develop amblyopia. Treatment is most successful before age 5 or 6, although recent research shows that even older children may recover their vision. If ignored, though, amblyopia can result in permanent vision loss",

It means that the energy stores in your body have been depleted—often by stress, worry, and the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Unfortunately, most of us combat this fatigue with “artificial” energy products (stimulants) that give a temporary boost but leave us more exhausted afterwards.Fatigue is the feeling of extreme tiredness or loss of energy due to physical strain, mental strain, or illness. Typically, fatigue is easily remedied through additional rest and relaxation. However, extreme or chronic fatigue is a more serious form of fatigue that can be caused by one of a number of diseases. Among these fatigue-causing illnesses are chronic fatique syndrome, diabetes, depression, and more. If you always feel tired and suspect some abnormal underlying cause, consider seeing a doctor when convenient.General fatigue can affect your daily life as well as those people who surround you and should be taken seriously. Difficulty getting restful sleep or constant fatigue during the day can be helped with natural remedies in addition to certain medications. Fatigue medications should be prescribed by a trained health care practitioner. Herbal medicines, natural therapies, and other alternative means can be explored more freely, but not all remedies are guaranteed to work for every person. Certain anti-fatigue products will help you be more alert and in tune with your surroundings. Find ways to help treat your fatigue right awayPossible Causes of FatigueThough little is known about fatigue prevention and treatment, fatigue may be related to a variety of medical and physical conditions and psychosocial factors. Fatigue can be caused by anemia or associated with major organ dysfunction, including severe heart or lung disease, kidney failure, or liver failure. Hypothyroidism (insufficient production of thyroid hormone) and adrenal problems, even if mild, can cause fatigue. Neuromuscular disorders, malnutrition, infection, dehydration or electrolyte disturbances can also be associated with fatigue, as well as sleep disorders, immobility and lack of exercise, chronic pain, or the use of centrally-acting drugs (e.g., opioids). Psychosocial factors associated with fatigue are anxiety and depression, stress, and those related to the reactions of others to the fatigue",

    "span_summary": "Fatigue is a common signal from the body indicating depleted energy stores, often caused by stress and daily pressures. While occasional fatigue is remedied with rest and relaxation, chronic fatigue may be linked to underlying illnesses such as chronic fatigue syndrome, diabetes, or depression. Seeking medical advice for persistent fatigue is crucial, as it can be associated with various conditions like anemia, heart or lung diseases, thyroid or adrenal issues, neuromuscular disorders, and more. Dehydration is identified as a prevalent cause of fatigue-like symptoms. Exploring natural remedies, herbal medicines, and medications under professional guidance can aid in managing fatigue. Incorporating sufficient rest, a balanced diet, and exercise is essential for overall well-being."

      "There are several types of leukemia. They are grouped in two ways. One way is by how quickly the disease develops and gets worse. The other way is by the type of blood cell that is affected.Leukemia is either acute or chronic. In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are blasts that remain very immature and cannot carry out their normal functions. The number of blasts increases rapidly, and the disease becomes worse quickly. In chronic leukemia, some blast cells are present, but in general, these cells are more mature and can carry out some of their normal functions. Also, the number of blasts increases less rapidly than in acute leukemia. As a result, chronic leukemia worsens gradually.Leukemia can arise in either of the two main types of white blood cells: lymphoid cells or myeloid cells. When leukemia affects lymphoid cells, it is called lymphocytic leukemia. When myeloid cells are affected, the disease is called myeloid or myelogenous leukemia.These are the most common types of leukemia:1.Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. This disease also affects adults, especially those age 65 and older. 2.Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in both adults and children. This type of leukemia is sometimes called acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). 3.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most often affects adults over the age of 55. It sometimes occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. 4.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurs mainly in adults. A very small number of children also develop this disease. 5.Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon type of chronic leukemia. This and other uncommon types of leukemia are not discussed here. The Cancer Information Service can supply information about them.",

Patients were told to consume this tea 4-6 times per day.Licorice tea will probably also help with the pain of the mouth sore, even if it does not make the sore heal faster, but it might help with that too.Licorice has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, which may help with the blister.One warning, though,  is that you should not consume too much licorice, especially if you have blood pressure problems.  A case report from the Netherlands reported that excessive consumption of licorice tea (about 3 liters per day, so a lot) can temproarily raise blood pressure.  This rise in blood pressure may drop back down after licorice tea stops being consumed, but it may take time"

      "An ulcer is an open wound that develops in the tissue of a digestive tract. There are two main types of ulcers- Peptic or gastric ulcers, they form in the stomach. The gastric juice that is produced in the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, mucus, and an enzyme called pepsin. Sometimes, the mixture of pepsin and acids acts on the wall of the digestive tract and the result is a peptic ulcer. Duodenal ulcer forms in the small intestines near the stomach. They are more common than gastric ulcers. How do you know if you have an ulcer? Pain! The pain may occur from 30 to 60 minutes after eating. The pain rarely comes in the morning, but usually follows after lunch and dinner. And it may occur after midnight. Intense burning pain occurs in the area of the lower chest and/or upper abdomen. Additional symptoms that may be experienced are weight loss, a decrease in appetite, anemia, nausea, and vomiting. There may be times when the pain of an ulcer seems to be gone and then it suddenly returns. Pain associated with ulcers affect different people in different ways. There are different causes for the formation of ulcers. In some cases the bacterium \"H. pylori\" is responsible for the majority of ulcers. It says that too much stomach acid aggravates the already existing problem. People who develop ulcers usually have a higher concentration of hydrochloric acid than is normal. Some medications are known to cause ulcers such as those used to relieve the swelling of arthritis. Aditionally care should be taken when using ibuprofen and aspirin since they can cause irritation and bleeding",
      "Tense, ambitious, hard-driving people are more likely to develop ulcers than calm people. Other causes are alcoholic beverages, caffeine, stress, and smoking. Drinks that often contain caffeine are soda, tea, and coffee. Chocolate also contains caffeine and should be avoided. \"The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide\" adds that the elderly are more susceptible to developing a stomach ulcer. People who do not eat regular meals or who are rushed during mealtime are also likely candidates for this type of ulcer. Although uncers can bleed, bleeding due to a stomach ulcer is rare, but it can be very serious. An ulcer that bleeds slowly over a period of time, may eventually lead to anemia, weight loss, decrease in appetite, and infection. A more serious complication of a persistent gastric ulcer is stomach cancer. When a duodenal ulcer goes untreated, the risks are low. However, bleeding from duodenal ulcers can cause anemia. Heavy bleeding from this type of ulcer may cause nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. Scarring from a duodenal ulcer can also cause a dangerous blockage.",

Currently, in the Western world, the average lifespan is around 77-81 years. Life expectancy worldwide varies due to differences in public health, medicine, and nutrition among countries. Intra-country variations exist, such as racial differences in the early 20th century United States, which have since reduced. Disparities persist between genders, with women generally outliving men, though this gap is narrowing. Socioeconomic factors, air pollution, occupation, genetic disorders, and drug use also influence life expectancy, emphasizing the impact of broader social, environmental, and individual factors on human longevity. In the United Kingdom, there is a notable gap in life expectancy between the wealthiest and poorest areas, influenced by factors like poverty and inequality.

    "spans": [
      "The oxygen dissociation curve is a graph that shows the percent saturation of hemoglobin at various partial pressures of oxygen.  Commonly a curve may be expressed with the P50  value.  This is a value which tells the pressure at which the erythrocytes are fifty percent saturated with oxygen.  (Bouverot, 1985).  The purpose of an oxygen dissociation curve is to show the equilibrium of oxyhemoglobin and nonbonded hemoglobin at various partial pressures (Oxygen Dissociation Curve).  At high partial pressures of oxygen, usually in the lungs, hemoglobin binds to oxygen to form oxyhemoglobin.  When the blood is fully saturated all the erythrocytes are in the form of oxyhemoglobin.  As the erythrocytes travel to tissues deprived of oxygen the partial pressure of oxygen will decrease.  Consequently, the oxyhemoglobin releases the oxygen to form hemoglobin (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997).  The sigmoid shape of the oxygen dissociation curve is a result of the cooperative binding of oxygen to the four polypeptide chains.  Cooperative binding is the characteristic of a hemoglobin to have a greater ability to bind oxygen after a subunit has bound oxygen (Oxygen Dissociation Curve).  Thus, hemoglobin is most attracted to oxygen when three of the four polypeptide chains are bound to oxygen.   Factors that Influence Oxygen Binding    *      Temperature- Increasing the temperature denatures the bond between oxygen and hemoglobin, which increases the amount of oxygen and hemoglobin and decreases the concentration of oxyhemoglobin (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997).  The dissociation curve shifts to the right.    *      pH- A decrease in pH (increase in acidity) by addition of carbon dioxide or other acids causes a Bohr Shift.  A Bohr. shift is characterized by causing more oxygen to be given up as oxygen pressure increases and it is more pronounced in animals of smaller size due to the increase in sensitivity to acid (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1997).  The dissociation curve shifts to the right.    *      Organic Phospates- 2,3-Diphosphoglycerated (DPG) is the primary organic phosphate in mammals.  DPG binds to hemoglobin which rearranges the hemoglobin into the T-state, thus decreasing the affinity of oxygen for hemoglobin (T and R State).  The curve shifts to the right",
      "The oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is an important tool for understanding how our blood carries and releases oxygen. Specifically, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve relates oxygen saturation (SO2) and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PO2), and is determined by what is called \"hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen,\" that is, how readily hemoglobin acquires and releases oxygen molecules from its surrounding tissue",
      "The oxygen dissociation curve is a graph that shows the percent saturation of hemoglobin at various partial pressures of oxygen. Commonly a curve may be expressed with the P50 value. This is a value which tells the pressure at which the erythrocytes are fifty percent saturated with oxygen"
    ],
    "span_summary": "For information purposes, the oxygen dissociation curve illustrates how hemoglobin in our blood binds and releases oxygen in response to varying oxygen levels. A key indicator, the P50 value, signifies the pressure at which half the red blood cells are saturated with oxygen. In the lungs, where oxygen levels are high, hemoglobin forms oxyhemoglobin. During circulation to oxygen-deprived tissues, the curve shows how oxyhemoglobin releases oxygen. The curve's sigmoid shape results from cooperative binding, enhancing oxygen affinity. Factors influencing binding include temperature, pH (Bohr Shift), and organic phosphates like 2,3-DPG, which decrease oxygen affinity, causing the curve to shift to the right. Understanding this curve is crucial for comprehending how our blood effectively carries and releases oxygen."

However, losing more than 5 lbs per week is generally not considered healthy, and most doctors recommend a maximum of 2 lbs per week. For a healthier approach, it's estimated to take around a year to lose a substantial amount of weight, and maintaining this weight loss is emphasized.

      "The skin of your finger consists of tiny little skin cells, 100's and 100's of millions of them.  Each cell is so small you would need a powerful microscope for looking at 100 of them.All cells are surrounded by a membrane.  Somewhat like a very, very tiny balloon filled with salty jello.  The insides of the outermost cells are salty and dehydrated because your skin grows from underneath, the dermis, close to the capillaries (blood supply).The outer skin, called the epidermis, consists of cells which are wearing out and drying up, although they are mostly not quite dead yet.  The very oldest ones that are dead come off when you scrub or shower. Some are falling off all the time, but they are so small you do not see them.Since the epidermis consists of rather dry cells, it is able to absorb water.  The cell walls allow the water in your tub, shower, or pool to penetrate into each cell.  The insides, being salty, are have a strong affinity for water.  If you spend a long time in the water, the epidermal cells swell up, increasing in size, somewhat like the the balloons mentioned earlier being filled with more water.When the skin on the outside of your hands or toes swells it has more surface area than previously.  Instead of being like a tight fitting glove, it becomes more like a glove that is too big.If you put on a glove that is too big, it will have wrinkles instead of being stretched smoothly.The entry of water into a cell is called osmosis.  If you stay in fresh water for an extremely long time, many cells will absorb so much water they will burst.  That is called lysis.Red blood cells are much more fragile than skin cells.  When combined with fresh water they rapidly absorb so much water that they all appear to dissolve.  Each one of the millions and millions of red blood cells has burst.  That is called hemolysis.Ropes made from plant fibers are also composed of cells.  Test a rope:  See if it shrinks in length when absorbing water or drying out.When the skin on your fingers and toes dries out, the cells shrink in size, and the skin becomes more smooth and taut, like a tight, well fitted glove.Your skin is very important.  Without it you would be just like a raw piece of meat, ready for the flies and germs to eat.Take good care of your skin.  Do not get sunburned.  When you have a bad cut that is healing, you should try to keep your hands out of dirty water or ponds.These contain potentially dangerous bacteria that could infect your open or healing wound.Taking a shower or washing your hands in clean water is okay.  Just be sure to put antibiotic ointment and a fresh bandage over the cut when you are done.Your teacher might be able to show you some pictures of bacteria (germs) or let you look at live ones through a microscope.  Only one person is allowed to look through at a time.  Everyone else must stand back and not push the observer or touch their head.  Otherwise you could injure one of their eyes or both by knocking them into the eyepiece or binoculars of the microscope.Some people have gone blind that way.  No horsing around !!

Premature babies might retain lanugo hair temporarily, leading to the misconception of abnormal hair growth. In some cases, a family pattern may contribute to the presence of lanugo hair on newborns. Certain conditions, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia and enzymatic defects like late-onset 21- or 11-hydroxylase deficiency, can cause abnormal hair growth in newborns."

T",
      "Regular exercise (I recommend swimming as the most effective) will definitely strengthen your heart, put your blood pressure at normal levels and reduce any sensations of heart palpitations that are associated with panic attacks.Third, take at least 2 hours per day to relax/meditate. I would recommend a combination of yoga, a soak in a hot bath or hot tub and a nap in quiet room with nothing but candles, very soft relaxing music. Turn off the phone, turn off the lights, lock the doors, just relax, breath, meditate. If you can afford massage, I think that is a way to complement this relaxation time.Fourth, when you actually have a panic attack, try this very simple strategy. First say to yourself over and over \"Everything is fine, it's just a panic attack. People have them everyday. It's uncomfortable but it will pass very soon.\" As you repeat this to yourself, breathe in very deeply and very slowly ... breath in for 4-5 seconds, hold for 4-5 seconds and release for 4-5 seconds. Do this sequence 20 times in a row. It will quickly reduce your heart rate and increase oxygen flow to your brain which in turns increases your rationality, thereby reducing your irrationality (the panic).Fifth, read the book I recommend. There are some special diet stratgies, possible food allergies that could be involved and vitamin/mineral supplements that can help you.Sixth, find a therapist that specializes in anxiety/panic disorders. You will need to find out what is the root cause of your panic ... that is, what exactly are you so afraid of? People do conquer panic attack"

It’s best to avoid caffeine since it causes dehydration and can act as a diuretic. Those who do enjoy caffeinated beverages on a regular basis should do so in moderation.A healthy diet is key for preventing constipation. A high fiber diet rich in fruits, vegetables, beans and nuts ensures regularity. Consuming an apple every day, with its skin intact, is another sure way to prevent constipation. Guava is another helpful fruit, but it should be eaten with its seeds to ensure the full effect. Starchy foods should be avoided when one is constipated as this will only escalate the problem.Regular exercise will also assist in one’s quest for regularity. Even if it’s a daily stroll in the park, exercise is important.If you’re feeling a little backed up, perhaps one or some of these remedies can help.Laxatives – There are many over the counter products to choose from in price ranges and formulas to suit everyone’s personal preference. If you’re not sure which product is right for you, check with your pharmacist or physician. Either is sure to recommend the product that is right for you. Lemon and Honey – Mix two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of honey into a glass of warm water. Drink one glass in the morning and one in the evening to bring back regularity. Orange Juice and Olive Oil – Drink a glass or mug filled with half each of orange juice and olive oil. It may not taste great but it will have your plumbing running smoothly in no time. Licorice – Licorice has laxative qualities. Eating several pieces of real licorice will help to relieve your constipation. Grapes – A large bunch of grapes should do the trick. Castor oil and honey – Honey seems to appear in many remedies for constipation. In addition to taking it with lemon and even by itself, one can also mix one teaspoon of honey with one teaspoon of castor oil. Something else a person who is suffering from constipation can try is a cup of tomato juice mixed with half a cup of sauerkraut juice and a quarter cup of carrot juice. It may not have a pleasant flavor, but it works great!When it comes to constipation, the important thing is to have a proper diet, drink water often throughout the day, and exercise on a regular basis.

In really unlikely scanrios when none of the medications intended for constipation work, it could be bowel constriction which would require immediate medical care and a surgical intervention. To alleviate constipation, one should incorporate a daily intake of fiber through food or supplements, including cereals with the recommended dose. Over-the-counter medicines like laxatives can also be considered. Preventive care measures include drinking at least eight glasses of water daily and minimizing caffeine intake.

    "spans": [
      "Nuclear medicine is a branch of medicine and medical imaging that uses unsealed radioactive substances in diagnosis and therapy. These substances consist of radionuclides, or pharmaceuticals that have been labelled with radionuclides (radiopharmaceuticals). In diagnosis, radioactive substances are administered to patients and the radiation emitted is measured. The majority of these diagnostic tests involve the formation of an image using a gamma camera. Imaging may also be referred to as radionuclide imaging or nuclear scintigraphy. Other diagnostic tests use probes to acquire measurements from parts of the body, or counters for the measurement of samples taken from the patient. In therapy, radionuclides are administered to treat disease or provide palliative pain relief. For example, administration of iodine-131 is often used for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis and thyroid cancer.Nuclear medicine imaging tests differ from most other imaging modalities in that the tests primarily show the physiological function of the system being investigated as opposed to the anatomy. In some centres, the nuclear medicine images can be superimposed on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight which part of the body the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated in. This practice is often referred to as image fusion.Nuclear medicine diagnostic tests are usually provided by a dedicated department within a hospital and may include facilities for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. The specific name of a department can vary from hospital to hospital, with the most common names being the nuclear medicine department and the radioisotope department.",

    "span_summary": "Nuclear medicine is a medical field and imaging technique that utilizes unsealed radioactive substances, or radiopharmaceuticals, for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In diagnostics, patients are administered radioactive substances, and emitted radiation is measured to create images, primarily showcasing physiological functions rather than anatomy. Tests may involve gamma cameras, probes, or counters. Image fusion is common, overlaying nuclear medicine images onto CT or MRI images. Therapy involves using radionuclides for disease treatment or pain relief. Diagnostic tests are conducted in specialized hospital departments, with various names like nuclear medicine or radioisotope department, emphasizing the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. Overall, nuclear medicine combines radiation therapy and molecular-level studies, employing radioactive substances to understand diseases and treatment modalities by detecting radiation and creating images of organ functions and substance distribution in the body."

      "Eczema TreatmentWhile eczema cannot be cured, most cases can be controlled by:Making lifestyle modifications to prevent flare-ups Seeing a dermatologist for treatment Using medication as prescribed",
      "This approach tends to prevent inflammation and itching and keeps eczema from getting worse. Dermatologists recommend that treatment be sought at the onset of signs and symptoms. When therapy begins early, it often reduces severity and duration. DiagnosisEffective treatment requires a correct diagnosis; however, it is not always easy to distinguish one type of eczema from another or from similar skin conditions. Dermatologists have the medical training and experience needed to determine if eczema is present — and if present, which type. To diagnose eczema, dermatologists examine the skin and ask about: When the skin condition first appeared Signs and symptoms, such as long-term pruritus (itching) or recurring dermatitis (inflammation of the skin) Certain circumstances that may aggravate the condition, such as excessively dry air or emotional stress Family medical history, including questions about close blood relatives who have asthma, hay fever, or eczema Personal medical history In some cases, a skin biopsy may be performed to rule out other causes. Allergies are more common in individuals with atopic dermatitis, and allergy testing may be considered when a patient has:Significant indications of allergies, such as gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea and colic in infants) or hives Been poorly responsive or unresponsive to treatment If a food allergy is suspected, testing for allergic reactions to eggs, milk, peanuts, soy, wheat, fish, and tree nuts (e.g., walnuts, cashews) are usually performed as these foods are responsible for 85% of all food allergies. A positive allergy test does not confirm the food allergy. A suspected food allergy must be subjected to a \"challenge.\" A challenge is conducted by having the patient eat the suspected food and observing the patient for a reaction. Even a challenge does not guarantee that the food is the trigger because: 1) another trigger may be present and causing the reaction or 2) the patient’s reaction may be delayed. Consequently, allergy testing has limited value. However, it is useful for eliminating foods that cause immediate and severe reactions or welts.Dermatologists may use a “patch test” to determine if the patient has allergic contact dermatitis, a type of eczema that develops when the person has an allergic reaction to a substance that contacts the skin. The reaction generally occurs a few hours after the substance contacts the skin and settles down within a few days if the substance does not contact the skin again. A patch test exposes the patient’s skin to minute amounts of substances that may have caused the reaction. When the test is positive, the dermatologist must determine if the chemical caused the dermatitis and if so, if it is the primary cause or an aggravating factor. Further testing may be necessary.TreatmentOnce eczema is diagnosed, a treatment plan will be made based on:Type and severity of the eczema present Age, health, and medical history (including presence of other conditions) History of previous treatment The primary goal of treatment is to relieve discomfort by controlling the signs and symptoms. Since eczema is usually dry and itchy, most treatment plans involve applying lotions, creams, or ointments to keep the skin as moist as possible. The treatment plan also may require lifestyle modifications and using medication as directed. A topical (applied to the skin) medication may be prescribed to help relieve itching and inflammation. Another way to treat the itch is with a non-sedating antihistamine. If itching is severe, a sedative antihistamine may be recommended. Skin infections caused by bacteria, such as staphylococ"
    ],
    "span_summary": "Eczema, though incurable, can be controlled through lifestyle adjustments, dermatological care, and medication adherence. Seeking treatment early is advised to minimize severity and duration. Diagnosing eczema involves skin examination, history evaluation, and sometimes skin biopsy. Allergies, common in atopic dermatitis, may be assessed through testing, but results are not conclusive. Dermatologists may use a patch test for allergic contact dermatitis. Once diagnosed, treatment plans consider eczema type, severity, age, and medical history. The primary goal is symptom control through moisturizing applications, lifestyle changes, and prescribed medications, including topical treatments and antihistamines. Treatment aims to relieve itching and inflammation, with adjustments based on individual circumstances. Skin infections may require additional attention."

Factors such as a history of heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and certain medications raise suspicion for peptic ulcers. The timing of symptoms in relation to meals can help differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers. Immediate surgery is required for a perforated ulcer, which is extremely painful."

      ". General commentsThe complex of anatomy of the vertebral column and the great concentration of important tracts in a structure of small cross-sectional area are unique features related to spinal cord injury. A number of factors influence the severity of pathological changes and functional deficits after spinal cord trauma, including age and the flexibility of the body, the size of the bony canal as influenced by heredity, degenerative changes of joints and intravertebral discs and variations in blood supply. The spinal levels most commonly involved with injury are the lower cervical spine (C4, C5, C6, C7, T1) and the thoracolumbar juncture (T12, L1, L2), the areas of greater mobility. B. Pathophysiology1. The spinal cord and nerve roots may be injured by: a. Compression from bone, ligaments, extruded disc material and tumors. b. Disruption or overstretching of neural tissues c. Edema following compression or concussion d. Disturbance of circulation 2. Mechanisms of injury a. Direct injury results from force applied directly to the back of the neck or trunk and may cause fractures of spinous processes of laminal arches, concussion of the spinal cord, or direct compression of neural tissue by depressed bone fragments. Lacerations can result from knife or bullet wounds. b. Indirect injury is a more common mechanism resulting from forces applied to the head and trunk or from movements that exceed the normal range, e.g. when the head is suddenly accelerated or decelerated in relation to the trunk. C. Pathological changes The most common pathological changes are contusions, with necrosis, swelling and hemorrhage acutely to variable extents. Chronic changes include macrophages, gliosis and loss of architecture. In addition, edema may occur in areas that do not show contusions and infarction may result from impairment of circulation. Wallerian degeneration in distal axons will occur. D. Clinical signsNeurological symptoms vary from complete loss of function below the injured segments to temporary loss of cord function with complete recovery. Specific symptoms depend on the site of injury. e.g. posterior horn or column injury produces paresthesias, pain and other sensory disturbances; anterior horn or corticospinal tract damage results in weakness or paralysis. After denervation, fibrillations, fasciculations, muscle atrophy, and groups of atrophic fibers in a muscle biopsy will be seen. E. Types of injury1. Fracture dislocation of the spine 2. Hyperextension or hyperflexion with cord compression by a displaced vertebral body fragment. 3. Cervical spondylosis 4. Intervertebral disc abnormalities and other osseous pathology, e.g. herniated lumbar disc 5. Neoplasms (intramedullary or extramedullary)",
      "spinal cord The spinal cord is a part of the vertebrate nervous system that is enclosed in and protected by the vertebral column (it passes through the spinal canal). It consists of nerve cells. The cord conveys the 31 spinal nerve pairs of the peripheral nervous system, as well as central nervous system pathways that innervate skeletal muscles.The vertebral column consists of vertebrae described as belonging to 5 groups (called segments). These segments are (in order from top to bottom): the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae, and the sacrum and coccyx"
    ],
    "span_summary": "For information purposes, the spinal cord's unique anatomy and concentration of vital tracts within a small cross-sectional area make spinal cord injuries distinct. Various factors, such as age, body flexibility, genetic influences on the bony canal's size, degenerative changes, and blood supply variations, affect the severity of injuries. Pathophysiological mechanisms involve compression, disruption, overstretching, and disturbances in circulation. Direct and indirect injury mechanisms can result in fractures, concussions, lacerations, and disruptions of neural tissues. Pathological changes include acute contusions, chronic macrophages, gliosis, and architecture loss. Neurological symptoms range from complete loss to temporary function loss, depending on the injury site. Injuries include fracture dislocation, hyperextension or hyperflexion, cervical spondylosis, intervertebral disc abnormalities, and neoplasms. The spinal cord, protected by the vertebral column, conveys peripheral and central nervous system pathways, innervating skeletal muscles. The vertebral column consists of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae, along with the sacrum and coccyx."

When lying down, this system can be momentarily disrupted, leading to a feeling of imbalance. This experience is commonly associated with the dream state, as the mind shifts from consciousness to deep sleep. The urge to reach out during this phase enhances the falling sensation. Some find this experience enjoyable, accompanied by a deep sense of relaxation, creating a feeling of unity with the bed. This phenomenon is known as astral projection, where individuals feel like they are leaving their bodies to explore altered states of consciousness."

      "working out anything past 45 min is a waste of time because you end up destroy your own current muscles for energy, and also leads to overtraining which will also waste your muscle and prevent them from recovering thus will not build you any new muscle. So working out 24 hours a day as stated above is pure stupidity.also 3X 20 sets is another stupid answer which will lead to what i already stated above.now here is the way to build muscle properly and increase the speed in which you will gain them:the secret to gaining muscle is to shock your muscles every work out. this can be done in the following ways:-changing the order of the exercise each work out- changing the speed at which you lift the weights, slow or faster-super sets which means doing two or more opposite or same body part exercises- giant sets which means no rest between all sets performed for a specific body part- negatives which means lowering the weight very slowly after one rep- stripping which means lifting the heaviest weight you can to muscle failure (when you can lift it anymore) for no more than 6-8 repetitions and then going to a slightly lower weight + repeatthat's only a few ways to shock your muscles into growing. Muscles have a memory so you must vary and change your routine and shocking methods constantly.also there is the diet component:proteins: make sure you eat a palm size protein portion every meal, which should be every 3 hours that you arent sleeping and do not eatt 3 hours before going to bed to prevent food from metabolizing into fat.carbs: 2 clenched fists is the ideal portionfats: olive oils, flaxseed oils, peanuts, almonds, no more than 10-12 or a table spoon per meal for the oilsmake sure you do not work the same muscle groups within 48 hours or 2 days to give them time to recover and grow.make sure you sleep at least 8 hours, as much of the recovery occurs during sleep.make sure you eat no more than 1 hour after your work outsmake sure you have a protein shake before going to bed, no other food if possible throw junk food, alcohol, and other tempting food in the garbage. keep your training to 3 sets of 6-8 repetitions per exercise@ 3 exercises per body partany more question, visit this excellent site bellow, and good luck",

    "spans": [
      "In order to be succeed at thinning your waistline, you have to get a basic under standing of how the abdominal muscles function and how your body burns fat.The first thing that you need to understand is the difference between fat and muscle tissue. Fat is created by eating excess calories and it is primarily stored in layers on top of your muscles. Muscle tissue consists of fibers that contract to produce movement.Fat can't turn into muscle, and muscle can't turn into fat. But you can lose muscle mass while you gain fat. That's what happens to most people, especially as they begin to get a little older.So if your goal is a trim waist line and a nice flat stomach, the first thing you need to do is remove the layers of fat that are sitting on top of your abs. Everyone has a flat stomach. It's just that some of them are covered with excess fat. The most effective way to flatten your stomach is with a combination of strength training (placing an extra focus on the mid-section), cardiovascular exercises (short, intensive workouts), and a stable blood sugar level to keep you from adding even more fat (and it makes it easier for the body to use your body fat for fuel). You have to do some type of progressive strength training. The ab muscle is primarily used to flex your torso forward. But there are also muscles that flex your torso to the side and other muscles that rotate it. Often you will see people on their ab roller every day doing lots of sit-ups or crunches. If you want to effectively strengthen your stomach muscles you need to incorporate these exercises:   1-2 forward flexion exercises (sit-up, crunch, etc.)   1-2 side flexion exercises (side crunches, side bends, etc.)   1-2 rotational exercises (standing twists, trunk rotations, etc.)  Your abs are muscles, and just like any other muscles, they should be exercised at most 3 times per week. You also want to make sure you're training them progressively, which means working them harder each time.   Increase metabolism using short, and hard, cardio workouts. Cardio workouts are very important because they can, if done properly, increase your metabolism for up to 24 hours or more!This means that you're less likely to store any excess calories as body fat simply because they're more likely to be used up by your higher metabolism. Plus, you're more likely to burn off some excess body fat in the process! Here's a simple interval workout that you can do with just about any activity (bicycling, walking, swimming, etc).  Warm up at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes   Perform 30 seconds of hard exercise (almost as hard as possible)   perform one minute of moderate exercise (recovery time to catch your breath)   Repeat this process from 6-10 times   Cool down at an easy pace for 2-5 minutes    Maintaining a stable blood sugar level is the key. Most importantly, you have to stabilize your blood sugar level! This is by far the most important factor when it comes to shedding that excess body fat and keeping it off!To stabilize your blood sugar level you have to feed your body frequently, about every 2-3 hours. The key is to give your body only the amount of food that it needs at that time. Your body burns calories all day long, so why would you only feed it once or twice a day?Give your body the fuel it needs: fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins (fish, lean beef, chicken, eggs, etc). Most people pay too much attention to how much fat is in food, or how healthy a meal is. Calories are calories. It doesn’t matter where they come from. If there’s extra it's going to body fat! I'm not saying that what you eat isn't important because it is. It just doesn’t have all that much of an affect when it comes to losing fat. Make healthy choices whenever possible, but don’t feel like every cheeseburger you eat is guaranteed to be st"

    "span_summary": "Achieving a trim waistline involves a comprehensive approach blending targeted strength training, cardiovascular exercises, and stable blood sugar maintenance. Fat, originating from excess calorie intake, overlays abdominal muscles, emphasizing the need for focused exercises. Incorporate a range of movements, including sit-ups, crunches, side bends, twists, and rotations, progressively intensifying sessions up to three times a week. Short and intense cardio, like interval training, boosts metabolism. Crucially, stabilize blood sugar levels by consuming balanced, frequent meals rich in fruits, whole grains, vegetables, nuts, berries, and lean proteins. This multifaceted strategy, encompassing exercise and dietary balance, is key to shedding excess body fat and attaining a flat stomach."

      "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosisAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurological disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neuron cells in the spinal cord and brain, which ultimately results in paralysis and death. The disease takes its less-scientific name from Lou Gehrig, a baseball player with the New York Yankees in the late 1920s and 1930s, who was forced to retire in 1939 as a result of the loss of motor control caused by the disease. In 1991, a team of researchers linked familial ALS to chromosome 21. Two years later, the SOD1 gene was identified as being associated with many cases of familial ALS. The enzyme coded for by SOD1 carries out a very important function in cells: it removes dangerous superoxide radicals by converting them into non-harmful substances. Defects in the action of this enzyme mean that the superoxide radicals attack cells from the inside, causing their death. Several different mutations in this enzyme all result in ALS, making the exact molecular cause of the disease difficult to ascertain.Recent research has suggested that treatment with drugs called antioxidants may benefit ALS patients. However, since the molecular genetics of the disease are still unclear, a significant amount of research is still required to design other promising treatments for ALS"

Trusses may increase the pressure within a hernia if a loop of bowel becomes trapped, resulting in strangulation; the blood supply to the loop of intestine can be cut off, killing the tissue"

    "span_summary": "For information purposes, surgery for hernias is typically reserved for cases where the hernia becomes strangulated. Modern hernia surgery is often straightforward, and for small hernias, minimally invasive procedures using a scope may be employed. In the case of inguinal hernias, trusses and corsets may be used temporarily to manage the hernia, but they are not considered a definitive treatment. While they might provide short-term relief for small hernias, there is a risk that they can increase pressure within the hernia, potentially leading to strangulation. Strangulation can occur if a loop of bowel becomes trapped, cutting off blood supply and causing tissue damage. As such, surgery remains a common and effective approach for addressing hernias."

      ": A \"cold\" (runny nose, sinus drainage, sneezing, miserable feeling) is called acute rhinitis.  It's a inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nose and throat and is caused by a virus.   There are many viruses that cause head-colds (acute rhinitis) and simply not being warm (no coat, gloves, etc) will not cause you to have acute rhinitis. You must be exposed to the virus before you can \"catch a cold.\" Sneezing causes airborne particles.  Someone who sneezes and has the virus can allow you to get the a cold.  Touching someone or something that has a virus on it can cause you to get a cold (acute rhinitis).The virus enters your body by way of your eye, nose, or mouth. Hand-washing is an excellent way to minimize the chance you'll catch a cold",
      "Both. Yes, you do get colds from airborn or surface viruses. However, your mother is right because being cold will lower your resistance and your immune system",
      "Research has shown that being \"cold\" does not make you more susceptible to colds",
      "For instance, Mom is cold at 72 degrees and that's just too hot for me.  In the research that has been done, \"cold\" is usually around 40 degrees with their feet in cold water. Even spending quite a bit of time like this, people were still no more likely to catch a cold when directly exposed to cold germs.Another reason I point out the relativity of being cold.  This idea has been around a long, long time.  When I read books written in the 1800s, the characters will talk about breaking the ice that had formed on the bedside water pitcher.  These people were sleeping in temperatures far colder than most people in developed countries can even conceive of.Still, it does seem like people get more colds during winter. It should be noted that this is the same whether you are in Chicago or LA. It's possible that germs like it a touch cooler than we do, or it's possible we simply stay inside more, which leads to a greater chance of being exposed to other peoples colds (also, there's a lot more travelling and socializing in November/December - yet more chances to catch a cold).  It could be that a good number of cases of colds are just \"cold stress\" - a reaction our bodies have to sudden changes in weather.  I know that my nose will run whenever we get a cold front come through.  We have no real data, even on whether there really are more colds in the winter.  So it's hard to tell why we get more colds during the winter.  But getting cold doesn't seem to be that much of a culprit",
      "3: When you are cold, your body can't protect itself as well from illness because it turns its attention to protecting you from the cold itself.  If you wear the hat and gloves and coat, when you are exposed to germs in the air and on surfaces, you will be more able to fight it off before it makes you really ill"

    "span_summary": "Experiencing a \"cold\" (acute rhinitis) is caused by a virus, and being exposed to the virus is necessary to catch a cold. Airborne particles from sneezing or touching surfaces with the virus can introduce it to the body through the eyes, nose, or mouth. Hand-washing is recommended to minimize the risk of catching a cold. While being cold itself does not directly make you more susceptible to colds, there is a correlation between colder weather and an increase in colds, possibly due to factors such as spending more time indoors and increased exposure to others' colds. Wearing appropriate clothing in cold conditions is advised for overall health and immune system support."

Childbirth typically lasts for hours, unlike a kick, which is a momentary event. The subjective nature of pain makes it challenging to determine and compare accurately, a task further complicated by the absence of a reliable pain meter. The unique experiences of giving birth and having testicles contribute to the incomparability. Personal observations, such as witnessing pre-labor, can influence one's perspective on these experiences."

This surgery is called herniorrhaphy. Sometimes the weak area is reinforced with steel mesh or wire. This operation is called hernioplasty.

Lots of things can enter the equation -- general physical health, type of lung cancer, other health conditions, where it has spread to, treatment choices, age, nutrition, etc.  And it is important to remember that even if the survival rates are low -- you could still be one of the survivors!I would start by seing a medical oncologist -- ideally one who tends to focus on lung cancers.  They will be in the best position to offer treatment alternatives and outlooks.  Think about what questions you want to answer and write them down before you go.  Take someone with you -- task them with being sure all of your questions get asked and have them take notes.  Don't hesitate to ask the doctor to slow down or provide more information.

Some patients seem to prefer less information in that area and some mds wait for the topic to be brought up.Some patients fight the disease with everthing medicine has to offer (some of which comes with significant side effects and/or contain invasive techniques).  Other choose to receive no medical treatment.  Still others pick and choose treatments with an eye towards quality of life rather than life extension.If you are in the latter category, good questions to ask about any treatment approach (including no treatment) is: a) what is the impact on quality of life; b) what is the impact on life extension; and c) what are the potential side effects and how likely are they.  Regardless of your philosophy, communicate your approach to your doctor.  They are in the business of helping you and they can best meet your needs when they understand what they are.Also, please remember that any decisions you make can be reversed -- you can start with very aggresive tx and back off if the disease responds poorly (or your body responds poorly to the tx).  Finally, allow you oncologist to help you with all of the symptoms -- some come from the disease while others can come from the tx.  Don't try and gut it out.  Let you md know about things like depression, anxiety, pain, appetite, nausea.  To some extent, these can be pretty effectively dealt with in the home.Now is also the time to consider things like what heroic measures you would like taken if you fall very ill and fill out forms such a DPA for health care.

The guidance also encourages consuming smaller, more frequent meals to prevent the body from interpreting it as starvation and storing fat. An alternative approach involves the \"rice diet,\" limiting daily calorie intake to approximately 1200 calories through a cup of rice and a piece of fruit per meal, potentially resulting in significant weight loss within a week.

A nurse practitioner provides some care previously offered only by physicians and in most states has the ability to prescribe medications. Working in collaboration with a physician, a nurse practitioner provides high-quality, cost-effective and individualized care for the lifespan of patient's special needs. NPs focus largely on health maintenance, disease prevention, counseling and patient education in a wide variety of settings. With a strong emphasis on primary care, nurse practitioners are employed within several specialties, including neonatology, nurse-midwifery, pediatrics, school health, family and adult health, women's health, mental health, home care, geriatrics and acute care. Nurse practitioners are educated through programs that grant either a certificate or a master's degree. A registered nurse is recommended to have extensive clinical experience before applying to a nurse practitioner program. An intensive preceptorship under the direct supervision of a physician or an experienced nurse practitioner, as well as instruction in nursing theory, are key components to most NP programs. physician assistants (PAs) are non-physicians licensed to practice medicine with a physician's supervision. This supervision, in most cases, need not be direct or on site and many PAs practice in remote or underserved areas in satellite clinics. PAs can treat patients and, in most states, prescribe medicine, and in some states in the US they carry a DEA number that gives them authority to prescribe controlled medications like narcotics. PAs in surgical practices also serve as first assists in surgery. PAs provide medical services that are reimbursed under Medicare and third party insurances. Physician assistants and Nurse Practitioners both provide similar services in most states, the major distinction being that nurse practitioners are registered nurses by trade. Both are also known as Advanced Practice Clinicians (APCs) or mid-level practitioners (MLPs)"

This form of cancer is almost always curable if it is found early. Most testicular cancers are found by men themselves, either as a painless lump, a hardening or change in size of the testicle, or pain in the testicle. Children born with an undescended testicle have an increased risk of getting testicular cancer, regardless of whether surgery is done to correct the problem.

Testicular cancer is more prevalent in young men aged 15 to 35 but can occur in other age groups, necessitating awareness of its symptoms by all men. Although relatively rare, testicular cancer is highly curable if detected early. Men often discover it themselves through the identification of painless lumps, changes in testicle size, or testicular pain. Individuals born with an undescended testicle face an increased risk of testicular cancer, emphasizing the importance of corrective surgery to preserve fertility.

      "Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). Multiple sclerosis (MS) usually affects woman more than men. The disorder most commonly begins between ages 20 and 40, but can strike at any age.The exact cause is not known, but MS is believed to result from damage to the myelin sheath, the protective material which surrounds nerve cells. It is a progressive disease, meaning the damage gets worse over time. Inflammation destroys the myelin, leaving multiple areas of scar tissue (sclerosis). The inflammation occurs when the body's own immune cells attack the nervous system.The inflammation causes nerve impulses to slow down or become blocked, leading to the symptoms of MS. Repeated episodes, or flare ups, of inflammation can occur along any area of the brain and spinal cord.Symptoms vary because the location and extent of each attack varies. Usually episodes that last days, weeks, or months alternate with times of reduced or no symptoms (remission).Recurrence (relapse) is common although non-stop progression without periods of remission may also occur.Researchers are not sure what triggers an attack. Patients with MS typically have a higher number of immune cells than a healthy person, which suggests that an immune response might play a role. The most common theories point to a virus or genetic defect, or a combination of both. There also appears to be a genetic link to the disease. MS is more likely to occur in northern Europe, the northern United States, southern Australia, and New Zealand than in other areas. Geographic studies indicate there may be an environmental factor involved.People with a family history of MS and those who live in a geographical area with a higher incidence rate for MS have a higher risk of the disease.Check out this article with excellent illustrations:http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000737.htm",

      "Thirst and drinking function to maintain body water balance and are basic to survival. Thirst is often associated with a dry unpleasant-tasting mouth and the feeling of a need to obtain water; it can result from dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, pharmacologic agents, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids. Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid. Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers. Although nurses are commonly confronted with client complaints of thirst, there has been minimal nursing research that relates to assessment of thirst and drinking behaviors, nursing diagnoses for thirst, or nursing interventions for persons with altered thirst or drinking behaviors.Thirst is the sensation indicating the body's need for water. Dry or salty food and dry, dusty air may induce such a sensation by depleting moisture in the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Relief through ingestion of water is only temporary, however, if thirst results from a generalized depletion of water in the system. About three fourths of the body is composed of fluids, and the average adult requires 21/2 qt (2.4 liters) of fluid per day, supplied by water, other beverages, and foods. Depriving the body of water interferes with its metabolism and functions, causing dehydration, which is eventually fatal. The unnatural thirst that accompanies fever, diabetes, and other disorders is caused by a rapid reduction of the body fluids. The sensation of thirst is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus in the brain. Dehydration of the cells triggers the posterior pituitary to releast the antidiuretic hormone (ADH",
      ", you loose water, it concentrates your blood and your brain detects this concentration (osmolality) and sends a signal to drink and to also limit excretion of water.  Its caused by the salt concentration of our blood as sensed by the brain.  IF you are thirsty, you are 1% dehyradted."

      ".During your menstrual cycle, there are far more infertile days than fertile days. The fertile days are days when there is a possibility for conceiving. However, within your fertile period - the window of opportunity for conception - there are days of \"peak fertility\". Identifying these peak times, and planning accordingly, can help maximize your chances of becoming pregnant.The Dynamics of FertilityA woman's fertile period during her menstrual cycle, on average, lasts about 9 days. The most fertile period consists of the few days before ovulation. There are a number of reasons why this is the most fertile time. First of all, the amount of cervical fluid increases - and the consistency of the mucus changes substantially (from being sticky and cloudy to becoming transparent, white, and slippery). The purpose of this change is to create a healthy medium for the sperm to survive and travel in. Given a fertile environment, sperm can live several days. The egg, on the other hand, can live only 24 hours - so timing is important. At the moment of ovulation, the body temperature begins to rise to create a warmer, more hospitable environment for a fertilized egg. Also, the cervix will start to rise, soften, and begin to open up.Hormones and Ovulation: The Release of the EggDuring ovulation, a number of different hormonal changes take place. Early in the menstrual cycle, a hormone called Follicle Stimulating Hormone - or FSH - enables your ovaries to nurture eggs. Within the ovaries, follicles house each individual developing egg. The follicles that hold the eggs will secrete estrogen. As the menstrual cycle progresses, the follicle containing the developing egg moves toward the surface of the ovary. Immediately before ovulation, the follicle begins secreting estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen helps the uterine lining thicken and expand, and increases blood flow to the uterus. Progesterone causes the glands of the uterine lining to form secretions that help nourish a fertilized egg.OvulationBy definition, ovulation is the process of an ovary releasing an egg from the follicle - permitting the egg to float down the fallopian tubes. On average, the first phase of the menstrual cycle last two weeks. Directly prior to ovulation, another hormonal change takes place - the LH Surge. LH (or Luteinizing Hormone) is the hormone that actually facilitates ovulation: it causes the egg to separate from the ovarian surface. Ovulation predictor tests function by detecting this LH Surge, thus alerting the woman that ovulation is about to take place.Once released from the ovaries (post-ovulation), the egg can survive for about 24 hours. This means that sperm (which can live several days) must be present to fertilize the egg. Following ovulation, the egg enters the fallopian tubes and continues toward the womb. Typically, conception - the uniting of the egg and the sperm - will take place in the fallopian tube, and then the fertilized egg will continue its passage to the uterus and implant in the uterine wall. For pregnancy to take place, fertilization of the egg must be followed by a successful implantation.Following ovulation, the luteal phase begins, marked by an increase of the hormone progesterone, which strengthens the uterine lining (endometrium) and causes the body temperature to increase, facilitates changes in the cervical fluid, and alters the position of the cervix.Within 24 hours, if the egg has not been fertilized, it will simply disintegrate after reaching the uterus. Without fertilization"
    ],
    "span_summary": "For information purposes, during the menstrual cycle, there are more infertile days than fertile days, with the most fertile period lasting about 9 days. The peak fertility days occur just before ovulation when hormonal changes lead to increased cervical fluid, a rise in body temperature, and changes in the cervix's position. Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) nurtures developing eggs in the ovaries, and estrogen and progesterone secretions from follicles prepare the uterus for a fertilized egg. Ovulation, triggered by Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surge, releases an egg that can survive for about 24 hours. For conception, sperm must be present during this time. Following ovulation, the luteal phase begins with increased progesterone, preparing the uterus and causing temperature changes. If the egg remains unfertilized, it disintegrates within 24 hours. Understanding these dynamics can help maximize the chances of conception."

CMV without symptoms is common in babies and young children. It is found in saliva, urine, semen, and other body fluids. The virus is easily spread in households and in daycare centers. It can be transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy and to the baby during delivery or in breast milk.Over half of women of childbearing age become infected with CMV at least six months before becoming pregnant. There appear to be few risks for complications of CMV for this group and only a few babies have the infection at birth. These babies appear to have no significant illness or abnormalities.About 90 percent of babies who are infected with CMV have no symptoms at birth. But as many as 15 percent of these babies develop one or more neurological abnormalities — such as mental retardation, learning disabilities, hearing or vision loss — usually in the first year or two of life.

Bird flu is challenging to spread through the air and does not typically transmit from human to human. The novelty of new strains makes it newsworthy, as individuals lack natural immunity. Getting a flu shot is not a guarantee of protection, as the World Health Organization predicts common strains for the annual vaccine, but there are numerous strains.

      "that matches the symptons here:PFIC (Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis)What is Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC)Taken word for word, it means: Progressive: tending to get worse over time; Familial: passed down to a child from the parents by way of the genes; Intrahepatic: involves disease inside the liver and not the bile ducts outside the liver; Cholestasis: means poor bile flow and build-up of substances in the liver that should be put into bile. The symptoms of PFICFIC1 and BSEP disease cause similar symptoms; together they are called low-GGT PFIC because of a blood test (GGT) that is low rather than high as in most other forms of cholestasis. These diseases cause cholestasis that begins in early childhood, with the average age at onset being 3 months. However, some patients do not get symptoms of cholestasis until they are teenagers or young adults. These diseases can progress quickly to bad scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) in the first year of life or more slowly with minimal scarring well into the teenage years. Few patients have survived beyond 20 years without treatment. Itching (pruritus) is the main symptom of cholestasis in many patients. Pruritus is often out of proportion to the level of jaundice (yellow eyes or skin), which is often low-grade and can wax and wane. Scratching starts as digging at the ears and eyes, which are the first areas to show bleeding and scarring. The itching may be very disabling and does not usually respond to medications. The scratching interferes with normal activities and sleep and may interfere with learning and schoolwork. Problems with growth are another major feature of PFIC. Almost all patients are short for their age, but they may not be thin. Delayed puberty and sexual development is common. Patients who are treated can have normal sexual development and several have given birth to normal children. Other common problems include frequent nosebleeds and wheezing. Fat-soluble vitamin (A, E, D and K) deficiencies are common in untreated patients. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to problems with vision. Vitamin E deficiency can lead to problems with balance, strength and coordination. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to poor bone formation. Vitamin K deficiency can lead to bleeding problems. For these reasons, most patients need extra vitamins. Up to a third of patients have gallstones. Most patients have an enlarged liver or enlarged spleen. Although similar, there are differences between patients with BSEP disease and those with FIC1 disease. For example, patients with FIC1 disease are more likely to have watery diarrhea, which can be severe, especially after liver transplantation. However, there is much that we do not yet know about these differences and this will only become clear as more patients are studied.Patients with PFIC but with high serum GGT have been called PFIC3, and are now called MDR3 disease. These patients have very bad cholestasis in the first year of life, which may progress in the first few years of life toward failure of the liver to do its normal functions. However, there are probably less severe forms of MDR3 disease that cause milder disease. The child and his family may first become aware that there is something wrong during school age or adolescence. Sometimes, problems may not appear until adulthood. The full spectrum of liver problems caused by MDR3 disease is just now becoming known"
    ],
    "span_summary": "Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) is a genetic disorder characterized by worsening cholestasis, a condition involving poor bile flow and the accumulation of substances in the liver. PFIC can be categorized as low-GGT PFIC when associated with FIC1 and BSEP diseases, leading to symptoms such as jaundice, itching (pruritus), and liver scarring (cirrhosis). Onset typically occurs in early childhood but can manifest later into adolescence or adulthood. Itching, often disproportionate to jaundice levels, is a prominent symptom and may be resistant to medications. Growth issues, delayed puberty, frequent nosebleeds, and vitamin deficiencies are common. Patients may also experience gallstones, an enlarged liver, and spleen. PFIC3, now referred to as MDR3 disease, involves severe cholestasis in early life and may progress to liver dysfunction. Variations in symptoms exist between FIC1 disease and BSEP disease, and MDR3 disease may present with milder forms. The understanding of these disorders is evolving as more patients are studied."

      "Addiction is defined as the compulsive need for and use of something that is psychologically or physically habit-forming, characterized by tolerance and by well-defined physiological symptoms upon withdrawal; Being abnormally tolerant to and dependent upon a habit forming substance (such as the endorphins caused by throwing up, or the habit forming behavior of bingeing and the fear of gaining weight that leads to purging/laxatives/exercise in bulimia).What matters most is whether or not the substance or behavior causes what we now know to be the essence of addiction: uncontrollable, compulsive drug craving, seeking, and use, even in the face of negative health and social consequences.Addicts are trapped in their behaviors and cannot simply quit on their own. They have an illness that requires biomedical treatment. People often assume that because addiction begins with a voluntary behavior and is expressed in the form of excess behavior, an addict should just be able to quit by force of will alone. However, it is essential to understand when dealing with addicts that we are dealing with individuals whose brains have been altered by alcohol, drug or behavioral abuse. They need addiction treatment.Today, scientists and physicians overwhelmingly agree that while use and even abuse of drugs such as alcohol and cocaine is a behavior over which the individual exerts control, addiction to these substances is something different. Scientists have begun to understand why addicted people may sacrifice everything that's important to them -- their jobs, their families, their homes -- in the quest for a fix.Best,`k."

Contrary to the misconception that addicts can quit through sheer willpower. Addiction is an illness necessitating biomedical treatment due to alterations in the brain caused by substance or behavioral abuse.

      "?The Most Frequently Asked Question of Any BeginnerDo you ever wonder why so many people join a gym in January and then it’s business as usual the end of February or mid-March?  There’s a couple of reasons.  First, working out is something you do as a habit.  Not just something you do for four weeks.  Many of the people, who join up, have no idea what’s going on.  They just sign up.  Hand over a year’s worth of dues and get on a machine.  The lucky ones get a 30 minute overview of the gym with a personal trainer.  And maybe the trainer is good.  And maybe not.  They have somewhat of a goal.  Lose weight.  Get bigger.  And they don’t have any idea of what their body can do.  After about 4-8 weeks of this, it’s old.  Not exciting anymore.  They don’t really like exercising anyway.  Now going to the gym is a chore that ranks with paying bills.  The excuses start (have to work late, pick up the kids, my <insert body part> hurts, I’m tired) and it’s over.  Second, if you don’t see results fast and I mean FAST, it’s over.  If you don’t lose 60 lbs in 4 weeks, then working out has failed you.  If you didn’t gain 40 lbs of muscle in a month, then you are a hardgainer and will be doomed to lead the life of a skinny guy forever.  There’s a whole group of people that want to obtain a certain body image.  But 16 years is way to long.  They want to be slim and trim or big and buff in 2 months for some occasion.  Or maybe they saw all the ads over the holidays, looked at themselves and said, yeah why not.  I’ll just join a gym.  Fitness is easy.  Nothing to it.  I’ll do a little here and there.  I’ll do cardio.  I’ll quit eating.  They quit too.So just how soon can you expect to see results?  On average, if you change your diet, follow a moderate to intense routine and introduce some interval training cardio, you will see results in as little as 4-6 weeks.  Nothing earth shattering mind you but changes.  Slow progress.  You might even start to feel internal body changes within a week.The key to getting the results you want as fast as possible is to monitor where you are now, where you want to be then and what you are going to do daily to get there.  Those that think results only come at the gym really never see results.  And they quit.Those that understand fitness is 24x7x365, will see results in 4-6 weeks.  When you wake up and eat breakfast or don’t eat, that is fitness.  When you consistently don’t get the rest you need, that is affecting your goals.  When you have no way to measure progress, it’s very difficult to tell if you are going anywhere at all.  Just because you cannot “see” something does not mean it’s not there.  Every time you pick up a weight or get on the cardio machine, jog or run, you are making changes in your body.  You might not see it but I bet you can feel it.Bottom line, there’s no magical number of when you might see some progress of your efforts but on average, in four to six weeks you can begin to see your efforts pay off if you understand that fitness is a lifestyle and not just another diet or thing you do when you have the time"
    ],
    "span_summary": "Many individuals join gyms in January but often lose interest by February or March due to various factors. For some, working out needs to become a habitual part of their lifestyle, not just a short-term commitment. Many newcomers lack a clear understanding of fitness goals, engaging in routines without proper guidance or realistic expectations. The pursuit of rapid, dramatic results and a desire for a specific body image within a short timeframe contribute to high dropout rates. Fitness progress typically takes time, with visible changes appearing in 4-6 weeks through consistent efforts in diet, intense workouts, and interval training. Understanding that fitness is a 24/7 lifestyle involving factors beyond the gym, such as diet, rest, and daily commitment, is crucial for achieving long-lasting results."

It is most obvious in the skin; however, the gastrointestinal tract, the respiratory, renal, cardiovascular, and genitourinary systems, as well as numerous vascular structures, are involved frequently. The symptoms result from progressive tissue fibrosis and occlusion of the microvasculature by excessive production and deposition of types I and III collagens. Other macromolecules found in the connective tissue (eg, glycosaminoglycans, tenascin, fibronectin) also are increased. The vascular alterations show a predilection for affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. The small vessel cytoskeleton is affected by structural defects that lead to collapse. Next, the tight junctions become altered and are no longer functional, allowing the endothelium to slip into the vessel lumen.From webmd:  Scleroderma (pronounced SKLEER-oh-der-ma) is Greek for hard skin.

PAGET'S DISEASE:Introduction:Paget's disease of the breast is a rare form of breast cancer in which the first clinical finding is usually scaling of the nipple skin. It may also be associated with nipple redness and burning. The diagnosis of this condition is typically made with a skin biopsy, which shows cells typical of this condition (Paget's cells). The \"good news\" about Paget's disease is that it is usually a \"curable cancer\". However, most cases of scaling and burning of the nipple are due to benign conditions which can be easily confused with Paget's disease.Making the Diagnosis:The major goal of this section is to help women (and their physicians) detect the early nipple changes associated with Paget's disease, and to help differentiate them from benign conditions. Making the diagnosis of Paget's disease is actually quite easy. We use a simple skin punch biopsy technique to remove a small piece of tissue from the area of the nipple with the abnormal changes. This procedure takes a few minutes to perform under local anesthesia and is painless. A small amount of skin and underlying tissues is removed and sent to the pathologist. In our experience with hundreds of cases it has proven to be 100% accurate. The first step in evaluating any patient with a change in the skin of the nipple is to obtain a careful history and to perform a careful breast examination, followed by a diagnostic mammogram. When performing a diagnostic mammogram the mammographer is informed about the posibility Paget's disease. Special films look for fine calcifications behind the nipple. If the mammogram is negative and our clinical suspicion is low, we usually suggest that the patient place a cortisone cream on the nipple for two weeks. If the condition has not responded completely to treatment in two weeks, we proceed to a skin punch biopsy. (a word of caution: we have seen cases of Paget's disease in which the mammogram was negative. The patient seemed to respond to treatment, but nipple changes recurred again in a few months. Therefore if a biopsy is not done, careful follow-up is recommended)."

Paget's disease is a rare form of breast cancer characterized by scaling of the nipple skin, often accompanied by redness and burning. Early detection is essential, and a skin punch biopsy is a reliable diagnostic method. While Paget's disease is generally considered curable, other benign conditions can mimic its symptoms, making a thorough examination and biopsy necessary for an accurate diagnosis. If there are changes in the nipple skin, seeking medical attention, including a diagnostic mammogram, is crucial to assess the condition and determine the appropriate course of action."

Some diets limit the amount of overall carbohydrate, while others focus on certain types of foods, generally ones high in starch and sugars, such as the “No White Foods” approach. Still others focus on how glycemic the diet is.It’s important not to equate “low carb” with the very low carb phase of some popular diets. These phases are usually meant to be quite short, with more carbohydrate phased in after that. Other diets begin at a higher level of carbohydrate, but still less than the USDA Food Pyramid suggests. Any diet whose primary focus is the reduction of carbohydrate in any way is what is meant by “low carb” on this site.

A strain of the H5N1-type of avian influenzavirus that emerged in 1997 has been identified as the most likely source of a future influenza pandemic and is known to have infected 133 people in Asia since late 2003, killing 68.[1]The avian influenza subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human deaths, are: H1N1 caused Spanish flu, H2N2 caused Asian Flu, H3N2 caused Hong Kong Flu, H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, H7N2, H7N3",
      "Bird Flu Hundreds of thousands of birds in Asia died due to a virus that has been dubbed the \"bird flu.\" The highly contagious illness is responsible for wiping out large numbers of poultry in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. The particular strain of influenza which has been reported as causing the deaths is called H5N1. Humans can contract the disease through close contact with infected birds, or with the feces of infected birds. It is not known to spread through human-to-human contact. There has been no indication that humans would get the disease through eating eggs or meat of sick birds.The only known way to eradicate the disease is by culling infected flocks. Thus far millions of chickens, ducks and other kinds of poultry have been culled in an effort to eliminate the virus. There have been several deaths due to the flu and the World Health Organization has expressed concern that the virus could latch on to a human influenza virus, potentially causing a serious epidemic. The bird flu's symptoms in humans include fever and coughing and eventual pneumonia"

    "span_summary": "For information purposes, avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is caused by influenza viruses hosted by birds but capable of infecting various mammal species. Originating in Serbia Montenegro in the early 1900s, it has become a global concern. The H5N1-type, identified in 1997, is a potential source of a future influenza pandemic and has caused numerous human infections in Asia, resulting in significant fatalities. Avian influenza subtypes in humans include H1N1 (Spanish flu), H2N2 (Asian Flu), H3N2 (Hong Kong Flu), H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, H7N2, and H7N3. The virus, particularly strain H5N1, has led to the death of hundreds of thousands of birds in Asia, impacting poultry in various countries. While the disease is highly contagious among birds, transmission to humans occurs through close contact or exposure to infected bird feces, with no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Eradication involves culling infected flocks, and millions of poultry have been culled to contain the virus. There is concern that the virus could potentially combine with a human influenza virus, leading to a serious epidemic. Human symptoms include fever, coughing, and, in severe cases, pneumonia."

Most women find that they do not lose all of their \"baby\" weight until they wean (unless, like me, you had plenty of extra weight before the baby, and your body isn't all that concerned about if that pound is a \"baby\" pound or a \"too many chocolate donuts\" pound!).  However, weight loss during breastfeeding is possible (living proof!).  The best way to go is to reduce the number of calories you eat and increase your exercise (I know, it's not as fun as taking a diet pill, but it lasts longer!).  While breastfeeding, your body uses about 500 calories a day to make milk for baby.  The most important thing for you is to make sure the foods you are eating are 80-90 % healthy (like during pregnancy).  If you eat junk, your baby will still get good milk, but your body will suffer because you will not get the vitamens and minerals you need.  As far as exercise goes, if you haven't been exercising, start slowly.  And remember, it took 9 months to put the weight on -- it will likely take 9 months to take it off."

While engaging in any comfortable postpartum exercise is generally acceptable, weight loss pills or supplements may pose risks as they could pass through breast milk to the baby. Although losing weight during breastfeeding can be challenging, it is possible through a combination of calorie reduction and increased exercise. The process may take time, often extending until weaning, but it is essential to prioritize a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals for both the mother and the baby's well-being. Starting exercise gradually and maintaining patience, considering the nine-month timeline, is crucial for sustainable weight loss."

      "The aortic valve is the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta.  This is where fresh oxygenated blood is pumped out to the entire body.  There are a variety of diseases that can require replacement of this valve, including aortic stenosis where the valve does not properly open and close, or an aortic insufficiency where the valve allows backflow of blood from the aorta back into the left ventricle of the heart.There are two major types of aortic valve replacements - mechanical valves and biologic/tissue valves.  Mechanical valves have been around longer and subsequently have a very refined safety and efficacy profile.  The downside is that after the procedure, the patient must be put on blood thinners for the rest of their life.  Biologic/tissue valves do not need subsequent blood thinner treatment and therefore may benefit younger, generally healthy patients.  However, it has been shown that the durability of tissue valves may be lower than mechanical valves, which may require a repeat operation later in life.There is a variation to the above procedures called the Ross procedure.  This procedure replaces the faulty aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve.  The pulmonary valve is then replaced with a tissue valve.  The rationale for doing this is that more strain is put on the aortic valve and therefore having the person's own anatomy in that place is preferable to having a weaker mechanical or tissue valve.  The pulmonary valve, which only pumps to the lungs (and therefore doesn't have to pump as hard) can withstand having a tissue valve, which isn't as durable.  In addition, this approach does not require blood thinners after the operation.Current cardiac surgery research is trying to investigate if valve replacement can be done in a minimally invasive way using catheter devices",

Its only job is to close so that backflow of blood back to the left ventricle will not be attained.. If the valve is not functioning properly the person's diastolic pressure will increase which will ultimately cause a cardiac infarction. The actual replacement can be achieved, but it is a very delicate surgery because the aorta is the biggest blood vessel in the body. Usually an aortic bypass is performed"

The Ross procedure presents a variation, replacing the aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve and using a tissue valve for the pulmonary position. This approach minimizes strain on the aortic valve and avoids the need for postoperative blood thinners. Current research explores minimally invasive catheter-based methods for valve replacement. Proper functioning of the aortic valve is crucial to prevent complications such as increased diastolic pressure and the risk of cardiac infarction.

      "All tea comes from the same plant--black, green, and oolong teas all have the same parents. The difference in the teas lies in how the teas are prepared after picking. Black and oolong tea are fermented, but Green tea is not. Therefore the active constituents remain unaltered in green tea. The most important ingredient in green tea is the phytonutrient eppigallocatchin or EGCG for short. This substance is a polyphenolic compound that acts as an antioxidant.What does EGCG do?Research has shown that these polyphenolic antioxidants protects the body against cardiovascular disease, and promote a healthy immune system. However in this new research, Professor Roger Thornley in England states, “We have shown for the first time that EGCG, which is present in green tea at relatively high concentrations, inhibits the enzyme DHFR or dihydrofolate which is a recognized, established target for anti-cancer drugs. This is the first time to our knowledge a known target for an anti-cancer drug has been identified as being inhibited by EGCG.” The scientist continued by saying that EGCG is probably just one of a number of anti-cancer mechanisms in green tea.It's also said to help reduce bad Cholestrol among many other help benefits which are still being researched. You will find several books and online claims about green tea - most of them are true but not all of them have been published in scientific journals yet because enough research has not been done yet.In short - it's good for you!",

Unlike black and oolong teas, green tea is not fermented, preserving its active constituents, notably the polyphenolic antioxidant EGCG. Research suggests that EGCG in green tea contributes to cardiovascular health, boosts the immune system, and may inhibit the enzyme DHFR, a target for anti-cancer drugs. Despite numerous claims about green tea's health benefits, not all are scientifically substantiated due to ongoing research. In general, green tea is lauded for reducing bad cholesterol, offering an alkalizing effect on the body, in contrast to coffee's acidity, and providing a rich source of antioxidants."

Physical and chemical properties:Aflatoxins are potent toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, immunosuppressive agents, produced as secondary metabolites by the fungus Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus on variety of food products. Among 18 different types of aflatoxins identified, major members are aflatoxin B1, B2, G1 and G2. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is normally predominant in amount in cultures as well as in food products. Pure AFB1 is pale-white to yellow crystalline, odorless solid. Aflatoxins are soluble in methanol, chloroform, actone, acetonitrile. A. flavus typically produces AFB1 and AFB2, where as A. parasiticus produce AFG1 and AFG2 as well as AFB1 and AFB2. Four other aflatoxins M1, M2, B2A, G2A which may be produced in minor amounts were subsequently isolated from cultures of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A number of closely related compounds namely aflatoxin GM1, parasiticol and aflatoxicol are also produced by A. flavus.

      "Dandruff is thought to be caused by a form of a skin condition called eczema, which causes increased shedding of normal scalp skin cells. Hormonal or seasonal changes may make dandruff worse.Here are some tips.Learn to manage stress. Stress affects your overall health, making you susceptible to a number of conditions and diseases. It can even help trigger dandruff or exacerbate existing symptoms. Shampoo often. If you tend to have an oily scalp, daily shampooing to remove the excess oil may help prevent dandruff. Cut back on styling products. Hair sprays, styling gels, mousses and hair waxes can all build up on your hair and scalp, making them oilier. Some people may even develop allergies to various hair-care products. Eat a healthy diet. For overall good health, include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and small amounts of lean protein in your diet. Get a little sun. Sunlight may be good for dandruff. But because exposure to ultraviolet light damages your skin and increases your risk of skin cancer, don't sunbathe. Instead, just spend a little time outdoors. But wear sunscreen on your face and body.",

    "span_summary": "HIV/AIDS is transmitted through bodily fluids, including blood, saliva, vaginal secretions, and semen, coming into contact with broken skin or mucous membranes such as eyes, mouth, sexual organs, or rectum. The risk of transmission depends on factors like virus levels and concentration in bodily fluids. Testing for HIV typically checks for antibodies, not the virus itself. Engaging in sexual intercourse does not cause HIV; transmission occurs if a partner is infected. Unprotected intercourse, especially if the insertor has HIV, poses a high risk, as the sensitive tissues involved provide efficient access to the bloodstream, facilitating potential HIV transmission. Regular testing and safer sex practices, including condom use, are essential for preventing the spread of HIV."
