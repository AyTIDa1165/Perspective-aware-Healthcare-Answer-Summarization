1309809,what is orgasm?,"For information purposes, an orgasm, also known as a sexual climax, is a pleasurable physical, psychological, or emotional response to prolonged sexual stimulation. It is often accompanied by physiological reactions like ejaculation, blushing, or spasms, and may be followed by aftershocks. It represents the third stage of the human sexual response cycle. Various factors, including physical stimulation, emotional connection, intellectual intimacy, and a sense of surrender, contribute to the experience of orgasm. While concepts like making a baby, dominance, submission, or even love might play a role, the presence of orgasm does not necessarily indicate the longevity of a relationship. The term ""orgasm"" once had a secondary meaning referring to a point of intense emotional excitement, but this usage is now rare.","For information purposes, an orgasm is a pleasurable response to sexual stimulation, involving physical, emotional, and sometimes spiritual reactions. Both genders can experience it, but the specific response varies.

1846165,when mutiple women live in the same house for extend periods of time do their periods really start to sycnrani,"For information purposes, synchronous menstruation, where women's menstrual cycles align when living together, has been observed. Research, including studies on lifeguards and college dormitory residents, indicates that cycles tend to synchronize, particularly among roommates and close friends, often within a few months of living together. This phenomenon is thought to be caused by pheromones or scent cues that women emit, influencing each other's hormonal regulation and causing their bodies to release hormones in a synchronized manner. While the exact mechanism is not fully understood, the presence of multiple women's hormones in close proximity appears to result in a collective regulation.","For information purposes, the phenomenon of synchronized menstruation, also known as menstrual synchrony or the McClintock effect, has been observed among women who live or work closely together. This synchronization is thought to be influenced by scent cues or pheromones.

1564117,I am extremely tired and an slowly gaining weight even though I diet-What's wrong with me?,"For information purposes, the experiences described could be related to hypothyroidism, a condition where the body doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones, potentially leading to weight gain and fatigue. Symptoms described also resemble symptoms of depression. The information recommends consulting a doctor for further evaluation. Dietary modifications, regular physical activity, vitamin and mineral supplementation, and adequate hydration are also cited as important factors.","Hypothyroidism, characterized by insufficient production of thyroid hormones, can lead to weight gain and fatigue due to a slowed metabolism. As metabolism naturally slows with age, maintaining an active lifestyle becomes crucial to prevent weight gain and associated complications. The assertion that you don't need to diet to lose weight suggests the importance of focusing on nutrient-dense foods rather than restricting calories excessively. Achieving the minimum nutrient requirements necessitates consuming around 5000 calories a day from the right sources, which is impractical in today's food environment. The statement also emphasizes that dieters, often characterized by poor eating habits and meal skipping, might struggle to meet their nutritional needs. Depending on factors like height and weight, the average woman requires around 100 grams of lean protein daily, 7-9 servings of fruits and vegetables, and at least one gallon of water to support overall health."

724848,why do your fingers get wrinkled when you get out of the water?,"For information purposes, the skin on your fingers wrinkles in water due to the absorption of water by the epidermal cells, the outer layer of skin. These cells, normally somewhat dry, readily absorb water (osmosis), causing them to swell. This increased size creates excess surface area, resulting in wrinkles. In contrast, when skin dries, the cells shrink, making the skin taut. The text also touches upon basic skin cell structure, the importance of skin for protection against germs, wound care, and general skin health maintenance, including moisturizing and protecting skin from sunburn.","For information purposes, the skin on your fingers is composed of numerous tiny cells, each surrounded by a membrane resembling a miniature balloon filled with salty gelatin. The outermost layer, the epidermis, consists of cells that are drying out and wearing out, continually replenished by the growth from underneath, the dermis. The epidermis can absorb water, allowing it to penetrate the cells and cause them to swell, akin to balloons filling with water. When skin swells, it increases in surface area, resembling a loose-fitting glove with wrinkles instead of a smooth, taut surface. Osmosis, the entry of water into cells, occurs during this process. Prolonged exposure to water can lead to cell bursting, known as lysis. Conversely, when the skin dries out, cells shrink, resulting in a smoother and taut appearance. Proper skin care is emphasized, including avoiding sunburn, keeping wounds clean, and moisturizing during winter. The importance of skin is highlighted as a protective barrier against external elements. Overall, good skin care contributes to a healthier and more appealing appearance for both boys and girls."

1316828,How can I get rid of gallstones without having surgery?,"For information purposes, gallstones, often composed of cholesterol, can cause pain when the gallbladder contracts to release bile for fat digestion. A low-fat, very low saturated fat diet may potentially reduce cholesterol levels and possibly decrease gallstone size and pain. If left untreated, gallstones can lead to gallbladder damage, infection, and potentially life-threatening complications. While surgical removal of the gallbladder is presented as a common and relatively minor procedure with minimal scarring, alternative treatments exist. ERCP is a minimally invasive procedure that removes stones from the bile duct but not from the gallbladder itself. Some people seek out holistic remedies.","Reducing saturated fats may shrink gallstones made mostly of cholesterol. Gallstone pain occurs when the gallbladder squeezes due to fat consumption. An ERCP procedure by a gastroenterologist can remove stones stuck in the duct leading to the intestine. This minimally invasive technique involves extracting stones or crushing larger ones for easier passage, but it doesn't eliminate stones within the gallbladder itself."
1316828,How can I get rid of gallstones without having surgery?,"Some of the causes related to gallstones and associated pain stem from dietary fat intake. Consuming a diet high in fat, particularly saturated fats, leads to increased blood cholesterol, which is a primary component of most gallstones. This, in turn, triggers the gallbladder to release bile into the intestines to digest the fat. The presence of gallstones during this squeezing action causes pain, akin to squeezing ""a handful of pointy rocks."" Untreated gallstones can also enlarge and damage the gallbladder, potentially leading to severe infection and death.","Gallstones left untreated can harm the gallbladder, causing severe infection and potentially death."
1316828,How can I get rid of gallstones without having surgery?,"It is suggested that you consider dietary changes to manage gallstones and associated pain. A low-fat diet, particularly one low in saturated fats, may help reduce blood cholesterol and potentially decrease the size of gallstones, as most are made of cholesterol. Lowering fat intake can also ease pain by reducing gallbladder contractions. While surgery is presented as a relatively straightforward option with minimal scarring and significant relief, other options are explored. You could investigate non-surgical options, and it might be worthwhile to consult a gastroenterologist about an ERCP, a minimally invasive procedure to remove stones from the bile duct, though it doesn't address stones within the gallbladder itself. It is also suggested that you explore holistic remedies by consulting with a holistic store. Be aware that high-fat diets can worsen gallbladder disease.","To eliminate gallstones without surgery, consider a low-fat diet, particularly low in saturated fats, as it may help reduce pain associated with gallbladder disease.

In the case of sexual dysfunction, underlying physical health issues, such as diabetes, should be ruled out by a doctor first, as dysfunction can be an indicator of other health problems. Hypnosis can provide a ""boost"" or enhance communication and trust between partners if physical causes are not present. As for inhibitions, hypnosis cannot force someone to do something against their will but can help explore discomfort and potentially modify unwanted inhibitions. Hypnosis is portrayed as a tool to aid in finding solutions rather than a ""magic wand."" The text also cautions against relying solely on hypnotherapy. It suggests that the core issues underlying sexual dysfunction or inhibition may exist and may need to be addressed directly through personal effort or qualified therapeutic help.

Further investigation should include checking urine for specific gravity, leukocytes/white blood cells, nitrites, pH, and blood/hemoglobin. A protein urine test strip uses a pH indicator that changes color in the presence of protein, with any green color indicating its presence. The test is highly sensitive to albumin but less so to hemoglobin, globulin, and mucoprotein. High specific gravity, highly buffered urine, alkaline urine (pH >= 9), and urine containing residues of chlorhexidine or quaternary ammonia compounds can cause higher than normal readings. The sensitivity of the urine test strip is 10 mg/dl albumin.","When protein is detected in a urine test, it signals the need for further investigation into an individual's health status. The test, which can be conveniently conducted at home, reveals protein levels within a normal range of 0-150 mg/dl, with values exceeding 150 mg/dl considered abnormal. These abnormal levels may indicate proteinuria, a condition with both benign and pathological causes. Benign factors include postural changes, excessive exercise, temperature variations, and pregnancy, while pathological causes involve conditions like renal issues and cardiac insufficiency. Additional assessments, including specific gravity, white blood cell count, nitrites, pH, and hemoglobin levels, are crucial when protein is found in urine. The protein urine test strip, utilizing a pH indicator sensitive to albumin, provides insights into health status and potential concerns, allowing for timely intervention and management."

489974,what is aortic valve replacement?,"For information purposes, aortic valve replacement is a surgical procedure to replace a malfunctioning aortic valve, the valve controlling blood flow from the heart's left ventricle to the aorta (the main artery carrying oxygenated blood to the body). Common reasons for replacement include aortic stenosis (valve doesn't open properly) and aortic insufficiency (valve allows backflow). There are two main types of replacement valves: mechanical valves, which are durable but require lifelong blood thinners, and biologic/tissue valves, which don't require blood thinners but may have lower durability and require future replacement. The Ross procedure is an alternative where the aortic valve is replaced with the patient's own pulmonary valve (which is then replaced with a tissue valve), avoiding the need for blood thinners. Current research explores minimally invasive valve replacement techniques. Aortic valve malfunction can lead to increased diastolic pressure and potentially cardiac infarction.","For information purposes, the aortic valve serves as the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta, facilitating the flow of fresh oxygenated blood throughout the body. Diseases such as aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency may necessitate the replacement of this valve. There are two primary types of aortic valve replacements: mechanical valves, which have a well-established safety record but require lifelong blood thinners, and biologic/tissue valves, which eliminate the need for blood thinners but may have lower durability. The Ross procedure presents a variation, replacing the aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve and using a tissue valve for the pulmonary position. This approach minimizes strain on the aortic valve and avoids the need for postoperative blood thinners. Current research explores minimally invasive catheter-based methods for valve replacement. Proper functioning of the aortic valve is crucial to prevent complications such as increased diastolic pressure and the risk of cardiac infarction. Aortic bypass surgery is often performed to address a malfunctioning aortic valve, acknowledging the complexity of the procedure due to the aorta's significance as the body's largest blood vessel."

The male genes activate later in gestation, halting further breast development but not reversing the already formed nipples. This is consistent across most male mammals due to shared ancestry and body plan. It's considered a genetic byproduct of early development rather than serving a specific purpose in males.","For information purposes, all eggs develop as female in the womb initially and possess nipples. However, later during the gestation period the male genes kick in, which stops the further development of female characteristics in a male fetus. It is a very typical occurrence in most of the male mammals present in the nature."
982305,why do men have nipples?,"Some of the causes for men having nipples are related to early fetal development. Initially, all fetuses develop as female, including the development of nipples. Later in gestation, male genes become active, halting further breast development, but the nipples remain. Furthermore, this trait is widespread in male mammals due to its presence in the common body plan established through evolution. This is a genetic backup retained from the initial female development stage.",The occurrence of nipples in male mammals happens due to every egg starting as a the same gender in the womb with nipples and the male genes kicking in later during the gestation period.
601301,How do  you get out mentrual blood?,"It is suggested to pre-treat menstrual blood stains by soaking the garment in very cold water before the stain dries.

Is there an alternative to the pill?,"For information purposes, the absence of menstruation (amenorrhea) can stem from various factors. Discontinuation of hormonal birth control, like the Depo Provera shot or oral contraceptives, can cause irregular periods, and it may take up to two years for the body to re-establish a regular cycle. Other potential causes of amenorrhea include early menopause, glandular malfunctions, chronic diseases, metabolic disorders such as diabetes, obesity, and malnutrition, tumors, and emotional distress leading to neurosis. Hormonal treatment may be employed if a tumor has been ruled out, and psychiatric help could be beneficial for neurotic disorders. It is recommended to consult a physician or gynecologist to investigate the cause of amenorrhea and rule out serious underlying conditions. Additional self-care information may be found at http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/53430-6.asp. The potential for complete cure or medical management depends on the underlying cause.","Early menopause is sometimes overlooked as a cause for missed periods, and birth control pills can also lead to frequent missed periods. It's advised to consult a Physician/Gynecologist to rule out the possibility of a tumor, as amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) can result from various factors, including glandular malfunction, chronic diseases, metabolic disorders like diabetes and obesity, malnutrition, and tumors. Emotional distress, such as an unhappy love affair or divorce, can also contribute to neurosis, affecting menstrual cycles.

633761,why isn't it that there so many hiv aids victim get from blood transmissions?,"For information purposes, while there's no vaccine or cure for HIV/AIDS, advancements in medicine have significantly improved treatment and management. Medications like protease inhibitors and strong antibiotics for opportunistic infections have transformed patient care, making it a more manageable condition than it was in the past. To prevent transmission through blood transfusions, potential blood donors undergo rigorous testing to ensure they are free from HIV and other bloodborne diseases and are not at risk. Healthcare workers face potential HIV exposure during patient care and follow strict protocols involving immediate medication administration for up to six months post-exposure, which MAY prevent the disease. The absence of a cure is attributed to late diagnosis in many individuals, the virus's rapid mutation rate hindering drug development effective against all variants, and its ability to hide within white blood cells, evading the body's immune response.","While there is no vaccine or cure for HIV/AIDS, medical advancements have significantly improved the treatment and management of the disease. Unlike two decades ago, it is no longer an absolute death sentence. Protease inhibitors and potent antibiotics for opportunistic infections have transformed the way the disease is handled in patients. Regarding blood donation, individuals must be at no risk of having the disease and undergo testing to ensure the absence of bloodborne infections. Healthcare professionals, exposed to potential HIV transmission during patient care, follow a protocol involving immediate medication after possible exposure for up to six months, which may prevent the disease. Due to the virus's constant mutation, designing a universal drug effective against all variants is challenging.

1811611,How do you overcome panic attacks? I've struggled with them for years.?,"For information purposes, panic attacks are extremely frightening and disabling. Overcoming them depends on the frequency, disruptive nature, and situational association of the attacks. Repetitive and frequent attacks may warrant consulting a mental health professional for psychological therapies or medication. Psychological therapies like relaxation training and exposure and response prevention aim at recognizing and working through attacks to decrease frequency. Medication, including antidepressants, may be used if therapies are ineffective, attacks are severe, or in conjunction with therapy; benzodiazepines should be avoided.

Alternative strategies include identifying and eliminating triggers such as caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. Regular, vigorous exercise is recommended to strengthen the heart and improve mental well-being. Dedicate time to relaxation and meditation, such as yoga, hot baths, and quiet naps. During an attack, repeat calming phrases while practicing slow, deep breathing exercises. Additionally, exploring diet, possible food allergies, and vitamin/mineral supplements may be beneficial, as well as seeking therapy to identify the root cause of the panic. Objectifying panic attacks as biological overreactions can also be helpful. Resources such as self-esteem affirmations and books on overcoming fear may provide additional support.","Panic attacks are highly distressing and potentially disabling, with overcoming methods depending on factors like frequency, disruption to life, and specific triggers. Psychological therapies, such as relaxation training and Exposure and Response Prevention, aim to recognize and address panic attacks, reducing their frequency over time.

4327181,Why are you even more tired after you get too much sleep?,"For information purposes, feeling tired after too much sleep can be linked to sleep stages. Sleep cycles involve stages 1 through 4, REM sleep, and repeating stages. Stages 3 and 4 represent the deepest sleep, characterized by delta brain waves. Waking up during these deep sleep stages can lead to a feeling of increased tiredness.","For information purposes, due to our sleep stages, individuals go through a cycle that includes stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, stage 4, and REM (rapid eye movement). The deepest sleep, occurring during stages 3 and 4, is interrupted by periods of REM and stage 2. At times, individuals may return to the deep sleep stages after an extended period, particularly if they sleep for an extended duration. However, being awakened during the deepest sleep, characterized by delta brain waves, can result in a feeling of crankiness or increased fatigue upon waking. This suggests a correlation between the sleep cycle stages and the impact of waking during the deepest sleep on morning mood and alertness."

The disease manifests with symptoms such as bronzelike skin pigmentation, anemia, weakness, and low blood pressure. Addison's disease, occurring across all age groups and equally affecting men and women, presents with weight loss, muscle weakness, fatigue, and low blood pressure. Darkening of the skin can also occur.  It is treated by replacing the deficient steroids through medications like hydrocortisone tablets or fludrocortisone. The dysfunction of the adrenal gland leads to inadequate secretion of essential steroids, including glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids."
902018,Does anyone know what Addison's disease is?,"Some of the causes of Addison's disease, a rare endocrine disorder, include: a malfunction of the adrenal glands resulting in primary adrenal insufficiency and inadequate production of cortisol and sometimes aldosterone; autoimmune responses where the body's defense system attacks the adrenal glands; or secondary adrenal insufficiency resulting from the pituitary gland not producing enough adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to stimulate the adrenal glands. These dysfunctions lead to the inadequate secretion of necessary steroids (glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids).","Addision disease occurs when the adrenal glands fail to produce enough of the hormone cortisol and, sometimes, the hormone aldosterone. Addison's Disease is a disease caused by partial or total failure of adrenocortical function. The most common cause is autoimmune i.e., the body's own defense system attacking the adrenal gland."

1264745,how many times can a person go through Defibrillation?,"For information purposes, the heart's ability to maintain function is the primary concern in resuscitation efforts. Defibrillation is used to restart the heart, similar to jump-starting a car battery. Resuscitation in a controlled ICU environment offers better neurological outcomes due to rapid intervention and consistent brain perfusion. While hospitals often limit shocks to three attempts at 400 joules, automated external defibrillators (AEDs) may continue delivering shocks, increasing the energy output until heart activity is detected.","For information purposes, the number of times a person can undergo defibrillation depends on the situation and the presence of medical professionals. In a hospital setting, defibrillation is typically attempted up to three times at 400 joules if there's no response. If there's still no heart activity after the third attempt, further shocks may not be administered. In a home or sport defibrillator scenario, the machine is computer-controlled and shocks until there is confirmation of heart activity or until the maximum preset number of shocks is reached. However, it's essential to prioritize addressing the underlying cause of cardiac arrest, as frequent defibrillation attempts may not be as critical as addressing the heart's overall condition, which is more concerning in the long term."

4428087,what is the average age of human life?,"For information purposes, the average lifespan of humans has varied significantly throughout history, offering insights into health and survival across different eras. Notable increases have occurred over time: from an average of 20 years during the Neanderthal and Neolithic periods to 28 years in Classical Greece and Rome. Medieval England saw an increase to 33 years, and by the end of the 19th century, the average lifespan reached 37 years. The early 20th century witnessed a substantial jump to 50 years, followed by 65 years around 1940. Currently, in Western countries, the average lifespan ranges from 77 to 81 years.

Variations in life expectancy are still observed globally, significantly influenced by differences in public health, medicine, and nutrition. Socioeconomic factors, such as poverty and inequality, contribute to disparities within countries, with wealthier areas often having significantly longer life expectancies compared to poorer areas. Additional factors influencing individual life expectancy include air pollution, occupation, genetics, lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and potentially drug use.","For information purposes, the average lifespan of humans has seen significant changes across different eras: Neanderthal and Neolithic periods had an average lifespan of around 20 years, while Classical Greece and Rome saw an increase to 28 years. Medieval England had an average lifespan of 33 years, and by the 1800s, it reached 37 years. In the early 20th century, it rose to 50 years, and around 1940, it was approximately 65 years. Currently, in the Western world, the average lifespan is around 77-81 years. Life expectancy worldwide varies due to differences in public health, medicine, and nutrition among countries. Intra-country variations exist, such as racial differences in the early 20th century United States, which have since reduced. Disparities persist between genders, with women generally outliving men, though this gap is narrowing. Socioeconomic factors, air pollution, occupation, genetic disorders, and drug use also influence life expectancy, emphasizing the impact of broader social, environmental, and individual factors on human longevity. In the United Kingdom, there is a notable gap in life expectancy between the wealthiest and poorest areas, influenced by factors like poverty and inequality.

4278766,Is there anyone who gained weight from the depo shot and pregnancy?,"For information purposes, the depo shot is associated with several side effects. A significant concern is weight gain, attributed to the hormones in the shot. This weight gain may persist throughout the duration of the shot's use. Spotting is also a reported side effect. Furthermore, it can take 12 to 18 months to conceive after discontinuing the depo shot. An IUD is mentioned as a potentially more effective long-term birth control alternative with a longer duration and fewer weight-related side effects. Experiences shared include significant weight gain (e.g., 35-44 pounds) and prolonged spotting. The possibility of weight gain from both the depo shot and pregnancy is implied in the associated question.

Spotting and a delay in fertility after discontinuing the shot (potentially 12-18 months) are also potential concerns. As an advisory note, if long-term birth control is desired, the IUD is recommended as a more effective alternative that generally doesn't cause weight gain. Further, genetics can be a contributing factor to the weight gain. Ultimately, a healthcare professional should be consulted to discuss individual circumstances and determine the most suitable birth control method.","It is suggested that the Depo shot be avoided due to several drawbacks, including issues such as weight gain, spotting, and a prolonged period of infertility (12 to 18 months) once one decides to discontinue the shot. Instead, the recommendation is to consider alternative long-term birth control methods.

4278766,Is there anyone who gained weight from the depo shot and pregnancy?,"In user's experience, the Depo shot has significant side effects, particularly weight gain attributed to the hormones in the shot. One user doesn't recommend the shot due to weight gain, spotting, and the delayed return to fertility after stopping it, suggesting an IUD as a more effective long-term option without the weight gain. A friend experienced significant weight gain and prolonged spotting on the Depo shot. Another user gained 44 pounds over three years on Depo, and despite stopping, the weight didn't come off. While taking phentermine helped, it's not a permanent solution, and doctors speculate it's due to metabolism changes with age.","Multiple individuals share their experiences with weight-related issues and hormonal treatments. One person expresses concern about the side effects of a hormonal treatment, citing a friend who gained 35 pounds and experienced continuous spotting for four months. Despite this, the individual decided against using the treatment. Another individual shares a different experience, noting a weight gain of about 44 pounds during three years on the Depo shot.

4352886,what is a NO CARB DIET?,"For information purposes, a no-carb diet eliminates or severely restricts carbohydrates, which are sugars or foods that convert to sugar in the body. Common sources of carbohydrates include pasta, potatoes, certain vegetables, cookies, candy, ice cream, and bread. Popular diets like the Atkins diet initially focus on very low carb intake to promote weight loss. While completely eliminating carbs may be difficult and potentially inadvisable, low-carb diets have gained popularity. These diets are based on the idea that reducing carbohydrate intake lowers insulin production, causing the body to burn fat and protein for energy. However, carbohydrates are not inherently bad, and choosing the right types is essential. Various low-carb diets exist, each with different approaches, such as limiting overall carbohydrate amounts, focusing on specific food types (e.g., avoiding starchy and sugary foods), or considering the glycemic index of foods. It's crucial to understand that ""low carb"" doesn't always mean extremely low carb for extended periods. Furthermore, some populations, like the Inuit, traditionally consume a primarily meat-based, carb-free diet, but this may not be suitable for everyone. Consulting a doctor or nutritionist is recommended for guidance on low-carb dieting.","For information purposes, a diet without carbohydrates, commonly known as a no-carb diet, is explored in the text. While acknowledging the popularity of low-carb diets in recent years, it cautions against the potential pitfalls of completely eliminating carbohydrates.

1174933,can kissing cause HIV  infection ?,"For information purposes, this summary addresses the question of HIV transmission through kissing and provides facts about HIV/AIDS. The common consensus is that HIV is not typically transferable through saliva via kissing. While theoretically possible if both individuals have open sores and exchange blood, the probability is very low. HIV is primarily transmitted through blood, semen, and sexual intercourse. HIV causes AIDS by attacking the immune system, specifically CD4+ T cells, progressively destroying the body's ability to fight infections. A healthy person has 800-1,200 CD4+ T cells, but in HIV infection, this number declines. When it falls below 200, the person is vulnerable to opportunistic infections and cancers, indicating AIDS. Adult males contract HIV through sex with other men (57.5%), injecting drugs (24%), and heterosexual contact (9.5%). Adult females contract HIV through injecting drugs (38%) and heterosexual contact (59%).","HIV is not transmitted through saliva. Transmission occurs through blood and sexual intercourse. The main causes of HIV/AIDS include sex with other men (57.5% for adult males), injecting drugs (24% for adult males, 38% for adult females), and heterosexual contact (9.5% for adult males, 59% for adult females). HIV disease weakens the immune system by destroying CD4+ T cells, making individuals susceptible to infections and cancers. AIDS, the end stage of HIV, is characterized by severe health complications such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological issues, and specific cancers like Kaposi's sarcoma. HIV likely induces AIDS by directly harming CD4+ T cells, disrupting immune response signaling, and damaging lymph nodes and immune organs."
1174933,can kissing cause HIV  infection ?,"Some of the causes of AIDS is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV causes AIDS by killing or damaging cells of the body's immune system, progressively destroying the body's ability to fight infections and cancers. The virus notably disables and kills CD4+ T cells, which are crucial immune cells. These cells play a central role in the immune response. Risk factors in contracting AIDS in the US are sex with other men (57.5% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through sex with other men in the US 2001), injecting drugs (24% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through injecting drugs in the US 2001 and 38% of adult females with AIDS contracted it through injecting drugs in the US 2001), and heterosexual contact (9.5% of adult males with AIDS contracted it through heterosexual contact in the US 2001 and 59% of adult females with AIDS contracted it through heterosexual contact in the US 2001).","HIV/AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which weakens the immune system by damaging its cells. This progressive destruction impairs the body's ability to combat infections and cancers. Individuals with AIDS are susceptible to life-threatening opportunistic infections, caused by normally harmless microbes that become harmful in weakened immune systems."
1174933,can kissing cause HIV  infection ?,"In user's experience, the common belief that HIV can be spread through kissing is largely untrue, though the misconception persists.

Some individuals suggest that while HIV transmission through kissing is unlikely, caution should be exercised regarding other potential infections like mono or herpes. It is crucial to get educated on how the HIV virus propagates throughout the world before it is too late.","In users experience, one user shares that kissing someone who is HIV+ is extremely unlikely to transmit the virus, especially if both individuals have no cuts in their mouths and the HIV+ person is on medication.

3282304,how fast do eyelashes grow? as fast as the hair on your head or faster?,"For information purposes, eyelashes, like all hair on the human body, grow at a similar rate. However, eyelash hair is pre-programmed to grow to a specific length, after which it falls out and is replaced by a new eyelash. This cycle takes approximately two to three months for an eyelash to fully grow. While damage, such as burned eyelashes, may appear to stimulate faster regrowth in anecdotal cases, eyelashes do not grow significantly longer than their pre-programmed length. There is a belief that trimming a baby's eyelashes encourages longer growth, but this is not scientifically proven.","For information purposes, all hair on the human body generally grows at about the same speed. However, certain types of hair, such as eyelashes, are pre-programmed to grow to specific lengths. For example, eyelash hair takes about two to three months to grow to a certain length before falling out, and a new one begins to grow in its place. This cycle repeats throughout a person's life. While eyelashes may appear to grow faster, they don't become exceptionally long because they naturally fall out and are replaced in a continuous cycle. This information is generally applicable to individuals beyond the baby stage."

It may take two to three weeks for physical lesions to appear after infection, but some individuals never develop visible outbreaks or experience only mild symptoms while still being contagious. If exposure to herpes is suspected, testing is recommended. If lesions are present, fluid from the lesion can be tested directly. If no outbreak occurs, a blood test for herpes antibodies (IgM antibodies for herpes 1 and 2, such as the HerpeSelect antibody test) should be conducted 8 to 12 weeks post-exposure to allow sufficient time for antibody development.","For information purposes, the onset of physical lesions in a herpes infection can take up to two to three weeks after being infected. However, individuals may respond differently to the initial infection, with some people never experiencing outbreaks (approximately 25%). Moreover, many individuals may only have mild symptoms or be asymptomatic carriers, meaning they are contagious without visible symptoms (asymptomatic viral shedding). It is best to get tested when you notice any lesions. A direct sample of the fluid from the lesions can be taken and tested for the herpes virus. Even in the absence of visible outbreaks, it's recommended to wait about 8 to 12 weeks from the time of exposure to undergo a blood test for herpes antibodies. This timeframe allows the body to produce detectable levels of antibodies. The HerpeSelect antibody test is a commonly used test for this purpose."

1667363,why do we fart?,"For information purposes, a fart, also known as flatulence, is the expulsion of intestinal gas from the body. This gas originates from two primary sources: the breakdown of food during digestion and fermentation, and swallowed air. During digestion, enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria break down food, releasing gases as a byproduct. Additionally, air swallowed during eating, drinking, breathing, chewing, or due to stress can travel through the digestive system and contribute to the formation of intestinal gas. This gas accumulates in the lower digestive tract and is eventually expelled as a fart, providing relief from gas buildup. It's important to note that farts are distinct from burps, which originate in the stomach. The decaying feces also produces gas and once enough gas accumulates, it is released.","Farting, scientifically known as flatulence, is the release of intestinal gas from the rectum. The gas results from various sources, including the breakdown of food by digestive processes and the swallowing of air. Enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria contribute to the release of gases during digestion.

1855693,what is thephysiology of thirst?,"For information purposes, thirst and drinking are fundamental to maintaining the body's water balance, a critical component for survival. Thirst, characterized by a dry mouth and a perceived need for water, can stem from various causes, including dehydration, decreased blood volume, dry mouth, medications, or a malfunctioning thirst mechanism. Drinking involves the physical act of ingesting fluids. Factors like temperature and taste influence both thirst and drinking behaviors. Thirst sensation may be problematic in individuals with restricted fluid intake, diminished in the elderly, or inappropriate in compulsive water drinkers.

Physiologically, thirst is triggered by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus of the brain which is caused by the salt concentration of our blood as sensed by the brain. These receptors detect changes in the body's fluid levels. When cells become dehydrated, the posterior pituitary gland releases antidiuretic hormone (ADH) to retain water. As a general rule, if you are thirsty, you are about 1% dehydrated.","Thirst and drinking are essential for maintaining body water balance and survival. Thirst is often associated with a dry mouth and the need for water, resulting from factors like dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, medications, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves motor activities leading to liquid ingestion and is influenced by factors like temperature and taste. Thirst may vary in discomfort, being diminished in some elderly persons and inappropriate in compulsive water drinkers. Nursing research on thirst assessment, nursing diagnoses, and interventions for altered thirst behaviors is limited. The sensation of thirst indicates the body's need for water, triggered by factors like dry or salty food and dry air. Relief through water ingestion is temporary if thirst results from generalized water depletion. The body, comprising about three-fourths fluids, requires adequate daily fluid intake to prevent dehydration, a condition interfering with metabolism and functions, ultimately fatal. Unnatural thirst in disorders like fever and diabetes is caused by rapid reduction of body fluids. Thirst sensation is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, triggered by dehydration, leading to antidiuretic hormone release and signaling to drink and limit water excretion. Thirst is related to the salt concentration in the blood, and feeling thirsty indicates approximately 1% dehydration."
