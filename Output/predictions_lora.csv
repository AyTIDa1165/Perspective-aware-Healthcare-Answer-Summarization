The Ross procedure presents a variation, replacing the aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve and using a tissue valve for the pulmonary position. This approach minimizes strain on the aortic valve and avoids the need for postoperative blood thinners. Current research explores minimally invasive catheter-based methods for valve replacement.

Drinking involves the motor activities that culminate in ingestion of liquids. Thirst sensation and drinking are influenced by many factors, including the temperature and taste of a liquid. Thirst may be discomforting in persons with limited fluid intake, diminished in some elderly persons, and inappropriate in persons who are compulsive water drinkers.","Thirst and drinking are essential for maintaining body water balance and survival. Thirst is often associated with a dry mouth and the need for water, resulting from factors like dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, medications, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves motor activities leading to liquid ingestion and is influenced by factors like temperature and taste. Thirst may vary in discomfort, being diminished in some elderly persons and inappropriate in compulsive water drinkers. Nursing research on thirst assessment, nursing diagnoses, and interventions for altered thirst behaviors is limited. The sensation of thirst indicates the body's need for water, triggered by factors like dry or salty food and dry air. Relief through water ingestion is temporary if thirst results from generalized water depletion. The body, comprising about three-fourths fluids, requires adequate daily fluid intake to prevent dehydration, a condition interfering with metabolism and functions, ultimately fatal. Unnatural thirst in disorders like fever and diabetes is caused by rapid reduction of body fluids. Thirst sensation is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, triggered by dehydration, leading to antidiuretic hormone release and signaling to drink and limit water excretion. Thirst is related to the salt concentration in the blood, and feeling thirsty indicates approximately 1% dehydration."
