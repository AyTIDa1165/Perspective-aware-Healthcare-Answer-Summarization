1309809,what is orgasm?,"For information purposes, an orgasm, or sexual climax, is a pleasurable physiological and psychological response to sexual stimulation experienced by both males and females. It represents the third stage of the four-stage human sexual response cycle. The experience is characterized by intense physical sensations potentially including ejaculation, blushing, or spasms and can be followed by aftershocks. While historically the term was used to describe intense emotional excitement, this usage is now rare. Orgasm is a complex experience influenced by physical stimulation, emotional connection, and psychological factors, but is distinct from long-term relationship success or love itself.","For information purposes, an orgasm is a pleasurable response to sexual stimulation, involving physical, emotional, and sometimes spiritual reactions. Both genders can experience it, but the specific response varies. It's the third stage in the human sexual response cycle, influenced by physical touch, emotional connection, mental intimacy, and complete involvement in the moment. Various factors like thoughts of procreation, power dynamics, and genuine love can contribute to the experience. While having orgasms with someone you love can be great, it doesn't guarantee the long-term success of a relationship."
1846165,when mutiple women live in the same house for extend periods of time do their periods really start to sycnrani,"For information purposes, the phenomenon of menstrual synchrony where women living in close proximity experience their menstrual cycles aligning appears to be a real effect. Studies, such as one involving lifeguards and another at a women's college dorm, have demonstrated that women sharing a living space can begin to menstruate within a close timeframe of each other, typically within the first four to seven months of cohabitation. The proposed cause for this synchronization is believed to be hormonal communication. It's theorized that women emit pheromonal cues, and prolonged close contact allows these scents to influence each other's hormonal cycles, leading the bodies to regulate and ultimately synchronize menstruation. This is thought to be a biological efficiency mechanism.","For information purposes, the phenomenon of synchronized menstruation, also known as menstrual synchrony or the McClintock effect, has been observed among women who live or work closely together. This synchronization is thought to be influenced by scent cues or pheromones. Studies have shown that women living in close proximity, such as in dorms or workplaces, may experience a convergence of their menstrual cycles over time. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is not fully understood, but it has been suggested that hormonal signaling plays a role."
1564117,I am extremely tired and an slowly gaining weight even though I diet-What's wrong with me?,"For information purposes, the presented concerns fatigue and slow weight gain despite dieting may indicate underlying health issues. Specifically, the symptoms align with potential hypothyroidism, a condition where the body doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone, which can lead to weight gain and low energy. Depression is also suggested as a possibility. Regarding weight management, the advice emphasizes balancing energy *input* (food) with energy *output* (exercise) rather than strict dieting. Maintaining metabolism is crucial with age, and increased activity, such as a 30-minute walk before dinner, is recommended. Nutritional needs are substantial; the average woman may require around 100 grams of lean protein, 7-9 servings of fruits and vegetables, and a gallon of water daily. Due to potential nutrient deficiencies in modern food, vitamin and mineral supplementation may also be beneficial. It is strongly advised to consult a doctor for diagnosis and personalized recommendations.","Hypothyroidism, characterized by insufficient production of thyroid hormones, can lead to weight gain and fatigue due to a slowed metabolism. As metabolism naturally slows with age, maintaining an active lifestyle becomes crucial to prevent weight gain and associated complications. The assertion that you don't need to diet to lose weight suggests the importance of focusing on nutrient-dense foods rather than restricting calories excessively. Achieving the minimum nutrient requirements necessitates consuming around 5000 calories a day from the right sources, which is impractical in today's food environment. The statement also emphasizes that dieters, often characterized by poor eating habits and meal skipping, might struggle to meet their nutritional needs. Depending on factors like height and weight, the average woman requires around 100 grams of lean protein daily, 7-9 servings of fruits and vegetables, and at least one gallon of water to support overall health."
1564117,I am extremely tired and an slowly gaining weight even though I diet-What's wrong with me?,"Some of the causes for experiencing extreme tiredness and slow weight gain, despite dieting, may stem from underlying medical conditions like hypothyroidism a deficiency in thyroid hormones or potentially depression. Additionally, a naturally slowing metabolism with age contributes to weight gain if not actively countered. Nutritional deficiencies are also a likely cause, as modern food supplies often fail to provide the necessary vitamins and minerals, potentially requiring intake levels (like 100g of protein daily for women) difficult to achieve through diet alone. Finally, imbalances between caloric intake and output, even with activity, can lead to weight gain; simply being active isn't always enough to offset intake.","Low energy and weight gain may be due to hypothyroidism, depression, or lack of minerals and vitamins."
1564117,I am extremely tired and an slowly gaining weight even though I diet-What's wrong with me?,"It is suggested that your symptoms fatigue and slow weight gain despite dieting could indicate underlying medical conditions like hypothyroidism or depression, and a doctor's visit is strongly recommended for diagnosis. To address weight management, rather than strict dieting, focus on balancing calorie intake with output through experimentation with food and exercise. It is advised to incorporate 30 minutes of walking nightly *before* eating, prioritize raw fruits and vegetables for fullness, and engage in enjoyable physical activity. Furthermore, consider the possibility of nutritional deficiencies; supplementing with vitamins and minerals may be beneficial given the difficulty of obtaining adequate nutrients solely through diet. Aim for approximately 100 grams of lean protein, 7-9 servings of fruits and vegetables, and a gallon of water daily, tailored to your individual needs. Finally, prioritize sleep, happiness, and consider a soothing drink like lemon juice with honey tea to support overall well-being.","While being active is beneficial, it's advised to consult a doctor for personalized weight loss guidance. To enhance weight loss efforts, consider incorporating additional strategies, such as walking for 30 minutes before evening meals, experimenting with food combinations, and trying various exercise routines. Balancing input and output is key, focusing on raw vegetables and fruits to feel full before enjoying other foods. Engaging in a sport or physical activity, even casually, contributes to overall well-being. Prioritize happiness, proper sleep, and enjoyment of life.

589732,anybody had kidney stones?,"For information purposes, kidney stones are a common condition potentially linked to dietary factors like high calcium oxalate (found in foods like tomatoes, milk, and plums) or uric acid intake (from a protein-rich, non-vegetarian diet). Diagnosis involves analyzing the stone's composition to guide dietary adjustments. Treatment typically begins with pain management, such as diclofenac, allowing the stone to pass naturally. However, interventions like Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL), various surgical procedures (retrograde ureteral, intrarenal, percutaneous nephrolithotripsy, or open surgery), utilizing energy sources like lasers, ultrasound, or pneumatic/shock-wave technology, may be required, particularly if the stone causes obstruction or infection. The size of the stone dictates the treatment approach, ranging from medication for smaller stones to lithotripsy or surgery for larger ones. The experience of having kidney stones is described as significantly painful.","For information purposes, the primary approach for kidney stones is non-surgical, focusing on pain management with diclofenac while awaiting natural passage. In some cases, surgical interventions such as Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL), retrograde ureteral or intrarenal surgery, percutaneous nephrolithotripsy, or open surgery may be necessary, especially when stones cause obstruction and urinary tract infection. Various forms of energy, including laser, ultrasonic, and mechanical methods, can be employed to fragment stones. The type of stone (calcium oxalate, uric acid, etc.) determines dietary adjustments, and medications or lithotripsy may be used for small stones, while larger stones may require surgical removal."

I've dealt with them multiple times, and honestly, the pain is far worse than anything I've gone through even getting a large-gauge piercing! From what I understand, doctors usually try to manage the pain with medication like diclofenac and wait for the stone to pass naturally, which is what I've gone through before. But if it gets stuck and causes an infection, they might need to break it up with sound waves (lithotripsy) or even do surgery. It's really important to figure out *what kind* of stone it is, because apparently certain foods like tomatoes, milk, plums, or a lot of meat and protein can contribute to different types of stones. Once you know what kind you have, you're supposed to avoid those foods. It's a whole process, and definitely not fun.","In users expereince, one individual had kidney stones several times and said, ""they suck"".

724848,why do your fingers get wrinkled when you get out of the water?,"For information purposes, the wrinkling of fingers and toes after prolonged water exposure is a biological process related to the structure and function of skin cells. The outermost layer of skin, the epidermis, is composed of cells that can absorb water due to their salty internal environment and permeable cell walls a process called osmosis. As these cells absorb water, they swell, increasing the surface area of the skin. This increased surface area, much like an ill-fitting glove, results in the visible wrinkles. Conversely, when skin dries, these cells shrink, returning the skin to a smoother, tighter state. While excessive water absorption can damage more fragile cells like red blood cells (causing hemolysis), skin cells are more resilient. Maintaining skin health is crucial for protection against infection, and practices like avoiding sunburns, keeping wounds clean, and moisturizing in dry weather are important for overall well-being. Good skin health can also be supported through diet, such as regular carrot milkshake consumption.","For information purposes, the skin on your fingers is composed of numerous tiny cells, each surrounded by a membrane resembling a miniature balloon filled with salty gelatin. The outermost layer, the epidermis, consists of cells that are drying out and wearing out, continually replenished by the growth from underneath, the dermis. The epidermis can absorb water, allowing it to penetrate the cells and cause them to swell, akin to balloons filling with water. When skin swells, it increases in surface area, resembling a loose-fitting glove with wrinkles instead of a smooth, taut surface. Osmosis, the entry of water into cells, occurs during this process. Prolonged exposure to water can lead to cell bursting, known as lysis. Conversely, when the skin dries out, cells shrink, resulting in a smoother and taut appearance. Proper skin care is emphasized, including avoiding sunburn, keeping wounds clean, and moisturizing during winter. The importance of skin is highlighted as a protective barrier against external elements. Overall, good skin care contributes to a healthier and more appealing appearance for both boys and girls."
119081,what causes night blindness?,"For information purposes, night blindness difficulty seeing in low light conditions can stem from several underlying causes related to the eye's retina and its light-sensitive cells. Specifically, retinitis pigmentosa, a disease causing deterioration of these cells (particularly rods which are crucial for night vision), is a common cause. Additionally, a deficiency in Vitamin A, a nutrient vital for retinal health, can also lead to night blindness. Other potential causes include cataracts, poor adaptation to darkness, myopia, certain medications, or congenital defects. Therefore, night blindness can be both a symptom of a larger disease, like retinitis pigmentosa, and a condition arising from nutritional deficiencies or other factors.","Night blindness is often caused by retinitis pigmentosa, a condition that results in the deterioration of light-sensitive cells in the retina, particularly the rods responsible for night vision. Additionally, a deficiency in Vitamin A can contribute to night blindness, as this nutrient is crucial for maintaining the health of the eye's retina"

1743567,Is there a cure of Adenomyosis?,"For information purposes, current treatment for adenomyosis focuses on managing symptoms, as a definitive cure is not widely established. While both medical and surgical interventions exist, pain medication (analgesics) is often the primary approach. Hormonal treatments have generally proven ineffective. In cases of severe symptoms, particularly for women not nearing menopause, a hysterectomy may be considered as a treatment option. Further information regarding treatment options can be found at resources like http://althysterectomy.org/adenomyosis.htm and WebMD.","Both medical and surgical treatments are available for adenomyosis. Pain medication (analgesics) is commonly used, and in severe cases, a hysterectomy may be necessary, especially for women not approaching menopause.

1115416,Why do women who spend a lot of time together have their periods at the same time?,"For information purposes, the phenomenon of synchronous menstruation where women living in close proximity begin to experience their menstrual periods around the same time is believed to be linked to pheromones. These odorless molecules, naturally secreted by both women and men (and found in the sweat of many mammals), are detected through the olfactory system. Research suggests that when one woman's pheromones are detected by another, it can influence the timing of their menstrual cycle, ultimately leading to synchronization over several months. While commonly observed, as evidenced by personal accounts like shared experiences in camps and college dormitories, the exact biological mechanisms driving this process remain a subject of ongoing investigation and are not fully understood. This addresses the question of why women who spend a lot of time together may experience menstrual synchronicity.","Men and women release odorless chemicals called pheromones. When women live together, the pheromones released by one woman can affect the menstrual cycles of others since the receptors in the nose detect the pheromones. Over time, their periods may synchronize, leading to a phenomenon called synchronous menstruation."
1115416,Why do women who spend a lot of time together have their periods at the same time?,"In my experience, I've personally witnessed this fascinating phenomenon what I understand is called synchronous menstruation happen not once, but twice. The first time was at summer camp, surrounded by around thirty girls in a single cabin. It was remarkable; it felt like, over just ten days, *all* of us started our periods.

1332000,Is it true that HIV can be transmitted through French kiss?,"For information purposes, the transmission of HIV through saliva, such as during a French kiss, is considered highly unlikely. While not entirely impossible, a substantial volume of saliva comparable to an Olympic-sized swimming pool would theoretically be needed for transmission in the absence of other factors. The virus is primarily transmitted through blood, and transmission via saliva is only considered a potential risk if both individuals have open sores or are bleeding profusely in the mouth, allowing for direct blood-to-blood contact. Current medical consensus indicates saliva itself does not contain a sufficient viral load to cause infection, though some conflicting opinions exist. It's important to rely on established medical science for accurate information regarding HIV transmission.","For information purposes, the likelihood of transmitting HIV through saliva during a French kiss is extremely low. Unless both individuals have bleeding sores or are bleeding profusely in the mouth, the amount of virus in saliva is typically insufficient for transmission.

1674195,Are there long term harmful effects to cracking your back all the time?,"For information purposes, repeated joint cracking, particularly in the back, may contribute to long-term musculoskeletal issues. Tendons connect muscles to bones, and overstretching them now could potentially lead to spinal problems, such as the need for back surgery, later in life as the supporting tissues weaken. Additionally, frequent joint cracking is associated with a potential increased risk of arthritis. Thepopping' sound is believed to be caused by gas bubbles within the joints that expand with repeated manipulation, rather than being reduced, potentially leading to chronic back pain and a reliance on cracking for temporary relief. While not a medical recommendation, the text suggests acetaminophen as a possible short-term pain reliever, and generally advises against habitual joint cracking. Regarding the specific question of long-term harm, the content implies that consistent back cracking *can* have detrimental effects over time.","Muscles are connected to bones by tendons, and overstretching them may not pose an immediate problem, but it can lead to issues later in life, especially around the age of forty. Over time, the vertebrate may lose the supportive muscle structure, potentially resulting in back problems that may require surgery. Continuous back cracking may provide temporary relief, but it can contribute to persistent discomfort, and relying on it may not address the underlying issues causing the ache. Maintaining good posture, regular exercise, and seeking medical advice for persistent back pain are essential for long-term back health."
1674195,Are there long term harmful effects to cracking your back all the time?,"It is suggested you cease habitual joint cracking, particularly in your back, to potentially avoid future health complications.

1791195,Is it Ok for your health to donate half a liter of blood?,"For information purposes, donating blood is generally considered healthy and safe. The human body typically contains around 5 pints of blood, and continually replenishes its supply, with a complete turnover approximately every 30 days. While losing a significant amount like 1 liter (2 pints) can cause shock, donating half a liter is well-tolerated. In fact, regular blood donation (e.g., once or twice a year) is believed to be beneficial for overall health, potentiallycleaning' the organism and contributing to a feeling of well-being. The body efficiently replaces donated blood within a relatively short timeframe.","For information purposes, donating blood is generally considered to be a healthy practice, and it is safe to donate within the limits set by blood donation organizations. The average human body has about 5 pints of blood, and blood cells have a lifespan of about 30 days. Donating blood periodically, such as once a year, can contribute to maintaining a fresh and healthy blood supply in the body. It not only helps others in need but can also have potential health benefits for the donor.

I've learned that our bodies are constantly replenishing blood a full refresh every 30 days or so so you bounce back quickly. While losing a large amount at once, like a liter, could be shocking, donating half a liter feels perfectly fine and my body recovers quickly, even within a day or so. It's something I genuinely believe is good for both the receiver *and* the donor.","In users expereince, one individual donates blood twice a year to feel fit."
1316828,How can I get rid of gallstones without having surgery?,"For information purposes, gallstones are frequently composed of cholesterol. Dietary modification, specifically a low-fat and very low saturated fat diet, *may* help reduce the size of existing stones and alleviate associated pain. This is because the gallbladder contracts when fat is consumed, and the presence of stones can cause significant discomfort during this process. However, dietary changes are unlikely to eliminate gallstones entirely. If left untreated, gallstones can lead to gallbladder damage, infection, and potentially life-threatening complications. Current medical interventions include surgical removal of the gallbladder a procedure often minimally invasive with small incisions and non-surgical options like lithotripsy (using sound waves to shatter stones). Additionally, an ERCP procedure can remove stones obstructing the bile duct, utilizing techniques to either extract or crush the stones for passage. While alternative or holistic remedies may be explored, conventional medical advice generally favors surgical intervention as the most effective treatment. It is important to consult with a gastroenterologist for diagnosis and to discuss appropriate treatment options.","Reducing saturated fats may shrink gallstones made mostly of cholesterol. Gallstone pain occurs when the gallbladder squeezes due to fat consumption. An ERCP procedure by a gastroenterologist can remove stones stuck in the duct leading to the intestine. This minimally invasive technique involves extracting stones or crushing larger ones for easier passage, but it doesn't eliminate stones within the gallbladder itself."
1316828,How can I get rid of gallstones without having surgery?,"Some of the causes of gallstone-related pain and complications stem from the stones themselves'typically formed from cholesterol'and the body's response to dietary fat. When fat is consumed, the gallbladder contracts to release bile for digestion, and the presence of gallstones causes painful squeezing. Additionally, untreated gallstones can grow large enough to damage the gallbladder, potentially leading to infection and, in severe cases, death. While a low-fat, low-saturated fat diet *may* help reduce stone size and pain, it won't eliminate existing stones. Ultimately, the most effective remedy for gallstones is surgical removal or procedures like ERCP (to remove stones blocking ducts) or lithotripsy (to shatter stones), though alternative, holistic remedies may be explored.","Gallstones left untreated can harm the gallbladder, causing severe infection and potentially death."
1316828,How can I get rid of gallstones without having surgery?,"It is suggested that dietary modifications, specifically a low-fat and very low saturated fat diet, may help manage gallstones by potentially reducing their size and minimizing pain associated with digestion. However, it's important to understand that diet alone is unlikely to eliminate existing gallstones. While exploring holistic remedies may be an option, consulting a gastroenterologist is strongly recommended. They can assess your specific situation and discuss procedures like ERCP to remove stones blocking ducts, or, ultimately, surgical removal of the gallbladder. Surgery, while potentially daunting, is often minimally invasive with quick recovery and is considered the most effective long-term solution. Though newer, non-surgical methods like lithotripsy (using sound waves to shatter stones) exist, further investigation is needed to understand their suitability. Ultimately, addressing gallstones is crucial to prevent potential complications like infection and gallbladder damage.","To eliminate gallstones without surgery, consider a low-fat diet, particularly low in saturated fats, as it may help reduce pain associated with gallbladder disease. Exploring holistic stores for organic remedies could offer natural alternatives, yet these might not eliminate existing stones. While sound waves can shatter stones non-invasively, they might not entirely remove them. Ultimately, surgical or medical intervention like ERCP may be necessary for complete removal if stones don't pass naturally."
1316828,How can I get rid of gallstones without having surgery?,"In my experience, dealing with gallstones is really about managing pain and considering your options. I tried adjusting my diet cutting way back on fat, especially saturated fats hoping to shrink the stones, and it *might* help with the discomfort. But honestly, I ended up having surgery about ten years ago, and it wasn't scary at all! The scars are tiny, barely noticeable. I know surgery isn't what you want to hear, but leaving the stones can lead to serious infections, and while there are other things people try like sound wave treatments or holistic remedies surgery really felt like the best solution for me. I even had kidney stone surgery too, and it wasn't as bad as I expected either. There's also this procedure called an ERCP that can help if stones get stuck in a duct, but it doesn't remove the ones *in* the gallbladder. After the surgery, I felt so much better, even with a little phantom pain afterward, which was nothing compared to the original pain. Ultimately, a low-fat diet can help manage things, but getting the stones removed usually through surgery is the most effective way to feel better.","In users experience, one user shares their experience of undergoing surgery to remove kidney stones, assuring that the procedure wasn't as daunting as expected. Despite the possibility of post-operative discomfort, the relief from the original pain was significant. They emphasize that the surgery for kidney stones isn't as intimidating as perceived."
1316828,How can I get rid of gallstones without having surgery?,"It is inquired how one might alleviate gallstones without surgical intervention, seeking to understand the full scope of options and their efficacy. The composition of most gallstones being cholesterol suggests a dietary approach specifically, a reduction in both total fat and saturated fats *may* contribute to shrinking the stones and lessening associated pain by reducing gallbladder contractions. However, it's understood that dietary changes alone likely won't eliminate existing stones. Further exploration reveals several potential, though varying, alternatives to full surgery. These include a non-invasive sound wave treatment to shatter the stones (details are unclear), seeking holistic or organic remedies, and a minimally invasive procedure called ERCP to remove stones obstructing the bile duct, though this doesn't address stones *within* the gallbladder itself. Despite these possibilities, the information consistently points to surgery as the most reliable remedy. Personal experience shared suggests the surgery is less daunting than anticipated, with minimal scarring and a significant improvement in quality of life post-procedure, even with the possibility of temporary phantom pain. Ultimately, the inquiry highlights a tension between seeking non-surgical solutions and acknowledging the practical effectiveness of surgical removal for long-term health and to prevent potentially life-threatening complications like gallbladder infection.",It is inquired if the person has seen a gastroenterologist

Other suggested solutions involve consuming substances like ice, sugar (a teaspoon or spoonful), or carbonated beverages to induce a burp, or employing specific drinking maneuvers like using a straw while plugging ears and nose, or drinking from the opposite side of a glass. Several methods involve manipulating airflow or swallowing, aiming to interrupt the hiccup reflex. It's important to note these are personal experiences and not medically verified treatments.",Holding your breath to cure hiccups does not always work for everyone.
595324,How do I cure hiccups?,"It is suggested that several methods may provide relief from hiccups. To begin, attempting to swallow saliva immediately after the first hiccup is a long-standing, reportedly effective technique. Additionally, applying an ice cube to the throat for 20-30 seconds or taking large gulps of water while holding your nose are recommended. For those who can easily burp, consciously attempting toburp out' the air bubble felt during a hiccup may be helpful, potentially aided by a carbonated beverage. Other options include consuming a teaspoon of sugar quickly to overload sensory receptors, focusing on and vocalizing a middle name, or employing one of two drinking techniques: biting down on the middle of a straw while drinking half a glass of water, or drinking from the opposite side of a glass while bending your head. While holding your breath is a common suggestion, it is noted to be unreliable. Ultimately, experimenting with these various approaches is advised to discover what works best for individual relief.","  To cure hiccups, you can try various methods, such as holding an ice cube to your throat for about 20 to 30 seconds, holding your nose while taking big gulps of water, swallowing saliva immediately after the first hiccup, and avoiding overeating. Additionally, you can take a deep breath and hold it, submerge yourself underwater and hold your breath, or set a glass of water with a straw on a table, plug your ears and nose, and drink from the straw. Consuming a spoonful of sugar quickly or focusing on your middle name for 5-10 seconds and saying it out loud are alternative approaches. If these methods don't work, biting down on the middle part of a straw and then drinking half a glass of water or drinking a full glass of water with your chin practically in the glass, bending your neck and head, may provide relief by stimulating the vagus nerve or interrupting the hiccup reflex."
595324,How do I cure hiccups?,"In my experience, hiccups can be really frustrating, and what works for one person doesn't always work for another. I've found that immediately swallowing saliva right after the *very first* hiccup is a foolproof method for me it's worked every time for as long as I can remember! I've also learned that overeating can sometimes *cause* hiccups, so I try to avoid that. I've heard a lot of suggestions over the years, some more reliable than others. Things like holding your breath sometimes help, but not always. I've also tried the ice cube on the throat trick, and drinking water with your ears and nose plugged while using a straw. Some people swear by a spoonful of sugar, though it can be hard to get down and you'll likely need water with it. One interesting idea I came across was focusing on, and then saying aloud, your middle name or a sibling's! If you're struggling to burp, someone suggested fizzy drinks like Coke or Sprite might help bring one on. And there are a couple of more unusual methods biting down on the middle of a straw while drinking water, or drinking water with your head bent way forward so your chin almost touches the glass. It seems like finding what works best is a bit of trial and error!","In users expereince, one individual says that they cure their hiccups by swallowing saliva immediately after receiving the first hiccup."

What caused it?,"For information purposes, this text details Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, both potentially impacting newborn vision. CNV typically arises from abnormal blood vessel growth under the retina, often linked to macular degeneration, and can lead to vision distortion or loss. In newborns, CNV is suspected to be caused by inherited eye diseases. The text primarily focuses on CMV, a common, lifelong viral infection passed from mother to baby. While most infected babies show no symptoms at birth (around 90%), up to 15% may develop neurological issues like hearing loss, vision loss, or learning disabilities within the first few years of life, making CMV a leading cause of congenital hearing loss. A smaller percentage (about 1 in 1,000) are born with noticeable symptoms like jaundice or an enlarged spleen, with a higher risk of severe neurological defects or even mortality. Currently, there is no cure for congenital CMV, though ganciclovir is being investigated as a potential treatment.","Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is commonly associated with macular degeneration, where new blood vessels grow through cracks in Bruch's membrane beneath the retina, leading to fluid leakage and bleeding, eventually causing damage to the overlying retina and resulting in decreased or distorted vision. In newborns, CNV may be linked to inherited eye diseases or cytomegalovirus (CMV), a lifelong, incurable virus related to herpes. CMV, often without symptoms, can be transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy or delivery, leading to congenital CMV infection. Most infected babies show no symptoms at birth, but around 15% may develop neurological abnormalities like mental retardation or hearing loss. Approximately one in 1,000 babies with CMV symptoms at birth may experience serious complications, and there is currently no treatment to reverse congenital CMV effects, although research is ongoing, including the investigation of antiviral drug ganciclovir's potential benefits for affected babies."

4381288,how long after your menstrual do you ovulate?,"For information purposes, ovulation typically occurs around two weeks after the start of menstruation, though this can vary. A method to help identify when ovulation occurs is tracking basal body temperature; a slight increase (approximately one degree Celsius) indicates ovulation and remains elevated until the next menstrual period. This temperature tracking forms the basis of natural family planning methods. Additionally, some individuals may notice a textural change in their cervix around the time of ovulation. However, it's important to note that these methods are not always 100% reliable for pinpointing ovulation.","On average, the time between ovulation and the start of menstruation is about two weeks. However, individual variations exist, and factors like stress, illness, or changes in routine can affect the menstrual cycle length. Some methods to estimate ovulation include tracking basal body temperature, observing changes in cervical mucus, or using ovulation predictor kits. Keep in mind that these methods may not be foolproof, and consulting with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance is recommended, especially for those trying to conceive or avoid pregnancy."
4388,My 6-year-old daughter had an ear infection and after Amoxicillin is having hearing trouble?,"For information purposes, following an ear infection and Amoxicillin treatment, temporary hearing trouble is common. This is often due to residual fluid buildup behind the eardrum, even after a fever subsides. Hearing should gradually improve as this fluid drains. It is crucial to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed to prevent bacterial regrowth and potential worsening of the infection. Persistent or recurring ear infections warrant evaluation by a specialist, as long-term issues like cysts can develop and potentially lead to hearing damage even requiring surgical intervention in severe cases. If hearing does not improve, or if new symptoms arise, a follow-up appointment with a doctor is recommended to rule out complications and potentially receive medication to dry up any remaining fluid. Self-diagnosis is discouraged; professional medical advice should always be sought. Recovery from an ear infection, and the associated hearing loss, typically takes time often a week to ten days even with treatment.","In the case of an ear infection, the presence of fluid behind the eardrum can persist even after the fever has subsided. The improvement in hearing is expected as the accumulated fluid diminishes. It is crucial to ensure that your daughter completes the entire course of Amoxicillin as prescribed. Failure to finish the antibiotic regimen may allow bacteria in the remaining fluid to multiply, leading to a recurrence of the infection and potentially worsening her condition. Consistent and thorough treatment is essential for a successful recovery from an ear infection."
4388,My 6-year-old daughter had an ear infection and after Amoxicillin is having hearing trouble?,"It is suggested that you allow time for your daughter's hearing to fully recover, as fluid buildup post-infection is common even after a fever subsides.

Should her hearing issues persist or she experiences recurrent ear infections, a referral to an ear specialist is recommended to rule out underlying issues like cysts, which can lead to long-term hearing damage. Additionally, it is strongly advised to consult a doctor directly for any medical concerns online forums are not a substitute for professional diagnosis. If the feeling of fullness or muffled hearing continues after the medication is finished, or feels like cotton in the ears, a return visit to the doctor to discuss drying medications is also suggested. Finally, don't hesitate to contact your doctor with any further questions or concerns.","It is suggested to give it time, otherwise call your doctor for concerns or get it checked out."
4388,My 6-year-old daughter had an ear infection and after Amoxicillin is having hearing trouble?,"In my experience, recovery from an ear infection and the return of normal hearing takes time. I learned this firsthand when my daughter had an ear infection; even after the fever breaks, fluid can linger behind the eardrum, harboring bacteria. It's *crucial* she finishes the entire course of Amoxicillin to prevent the infection from flaring up again. I also unfortunately experienced prolonged hearing issues myself after repeated ear infections. What started as a feeling of fullness, like cotton in my ears, eventually led to the discovery of a cyst that damaged my hearing so severely, I needed surgery to remove bones in my ear. It was a situation that could have been addressed much earlier with a specialist. So, if your daughter has frequent ear infections, definitely consider seeking a referral. I also remember having an ear infection years ago where my hearing didn't immediately return to normal after the antibiotics; it took a full week or ten days to feel better. And, like I knew from my nursing background, sometimes you need something *additional* to dry up any remaining fluid my doctor prescribed something for that, though I can't recall the name. Ultimately, it's best to follow up with a doctor if her hearing doesn't improve, and definitely don't rely on online advice for a diagnosis.","Hearing impairment following an ear infection can have various causes. In one individual's case, a cyst in the ear canal led to damage to the hearing bones, requiring the removal of two-thirds of them. Another individual experienced temporary hearing loss even after the ear infection had cleared, which was addressed by a medication to dry up the remaining fluid. The recovery process varies, and in some instances, seeking medical attention to address lingering issues is crucial for optimal hearing restoration."

4376911,Why do you sweat when under pressure?,"For information purposes, sweating when under pressure is a physiological response rooted in the body'sfight or flight' mechanism. This is a natural reaction to perceived threats whether physical danger or stressful situations like public speaking. When experiencing nervousness, anxiety, or fear, the body increases activity in the sympathetic nervous system and releases epinephrine (adrenaline) from the adrenal gland. These substances stimulate sweat glands, particularly in the palms and armpits, causing what is often described as acold' sweat. This response is a protective mechanism, preparing the body for potential action by cooling it and heightening senses. Furthermore, changes in skin's electrical resistance due to this nerve activity are measurable and form the basis of the galvanic skin response, sometimes used in lie detector tests.","For information purposes, the sensation of sweating, especially in response to nervousness, anxiety, or fear, is a physiological response rooted in the human body's ""fight or flight"" mechanism. When faced with stressors or threats, the body activates various responses to prepare for action. This includes an increase in sympathetic nerve activity and the secretion of epinephrine from the adrenal gland. These substances affect sweat glands, particularly in the palms of the hands and armpits, leading to increased sweating.

My friends tell me im anorexic.?,"For information purposes, this content discusses healthy weight ranges and potential indicators of eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia. A height/weight chart is presented as a *general guideline*, with the understanding that individual bodies vary. Being naturally thin is distinguished from unhealthy weight loss; someone who eats when hungry and doesn't obsess over food is likely simply naturally slender. Key danger signs suggesting a potential problem include restricting food based on fat content, constant negative self-perception regarding body image, and obsessive thoughts about one's figure. Anorexia is defined as weight loss *through not eating*, while bulimia involves purging after eating. Both conditions can have serious long-term health consequences, including potential impacts on fertility. The content stresses that it's okay to be thin *as long as* it's achieved through healthy means. If weight gain is desired, the recommendation is to focus on healthy protein-rich meals and exercise. It also clarifies that simply being thin does *not* automatically equate to having anorexia, and specifically states that *vomiting after eating is a defining characteristic of bulimia, not anorexia*.Regarding the associated questionI am thin and weigh 104 lbs.

If you consistently restrict food types due to fear of fat content, frequently feel negatively about your body image, or obsess over your weight, these are potential warning signs. Conversely, if you eat when hungry without undue worry, you are likely naturally thin. It's important to remember that anorexia and bulimia are serious conditions anorexia involves actively *not* eating to lose weight, while bulimia involves purging after eating.

489974,what is aortic valve replacement?,"For information purposes, aortic valve replacement is a surgical procedure to address dysfunction of the aortic valve the valve controlling blood flow from the heart's left ventricle to the aorta and, subsequently, the entire body. This replacement becomes necessary in conditions like aortic stenosis (valve doesn't open fully) or aortic insufficiency (backflow of blood). There are three primary approaches to aortic valve replacement. **Mechanical valves** offer proven durability but require lifelong blood thinner medication. **Biologic/tissue valves** eliminate the need for blood thinners but may be less durable, potentially requiring future replacement. A third option, the **Ross procedure**, utilizes the patient's own pulmonary valve to replace the aortic valve, followed by a tissue valve replacement of the pulmonary valve; this also avoids long-term blood thinner use. Currently, research focuses on developing minimally invasive techniques for aortic valve replacement using catheter-based devices. A malfunctioning aortic valve can lead to increased diastolic pressure and potentially cardiac infarction, making successful replacement a critical, though delicate, surgical intervention due to the aorta's size and importance.","For information purposes, the aortic valve serves as the gateway between the left ventricle and the aorta, facilitating the flow of fresh oxygenated blood throughout the body. Diseases such as aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency may necessitate the replacement of this valve. There are two primary types of aortic valve replacements: mechanical valves, which have a well-established safety record but require lifelong blood thinners, and biologic/tissue valves, which eliminate the need for blood thinners but may have lower durability. The Ross procedure presents a variation, replacing the aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve and using a tissue valve for the pulmonary position. This approach minimizes strain on the aortic valve and avoids the need for postoperative blood thinners. Current research explores minimally invasive catheter-based methods for valve replacement. Proper functioning of the aortic valve is crucial to prevent complications such as increased diastolic pressure and the risk of cardiac infarction. Aortic bypass surgery is often performed to address a malfunctioning aortic valve, acknowledging the complexity of the procedure due to the aorta's significance as the body's largest blood vessel."

It feels like a weird little bump between being awake and asleep, almost like your balance is off because your body is relaxing deeply into the mattress. I think it has something to do with how our inner balance system works when we lie down, and maybe even how our minds are switching into sleep mode. Honestly, it can be a really good feeling, a nice sense of letting go. Some people even think it's something more like astral projection, leaving your body which is a pretty wild idea! But mostly, it just feels like a quirky thing that happens when you're trying to fall asleep, and it's good to know others experience it too.",Many individual experience the feeling of falling while sleeping.

827774,would i contract aids i had o r a l sex with a h i v positive female?,"For information purposes, oral sex carries a risk of HIV transmission, though the likelihood is considered lower than with other sexual activities. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) identifies potential routes of infection during oral sex, including through the urethral, vaginal, or anal linings, or via cuts/sores allowing direct entry into the body. The risk is increased if the giving partner has cuts or sores in their mouth. While the exact probability of contracting HIV through oral sex is not definitively known, it is acknowledged as a non-negligible possibility.","Engaging in oral sex with an HIV+ partner carries a risk of contracting HIV, and this risk is higher than abstaining from sexual activity. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) explains that HIV transmission can occur through oral sex if there are open sores or cuts in the mouth, as the virus can enter the body through these openings or through the linings of the urethra, vagina, cervix, or anus. The likelihood of transmission increases when either partner has cuts or sores in their mouth."
982305,why do men have nipples?,"For information purposes, men have nipples due to the initial developmental process in the womb. All embryos begin as female, and nipples start to form during early gestation *before* male genes activate. When male genes eventually trigger development of male characteristics, breast development is halted, but the already-formed nipples remain. This is a common trait across nearly all male mammals, representing a fundamental aspect of mammalian body plan and potentially a geneticbackup.' While speculative, some theories suggest nipples may even play a role in sexual attraction. Essentially, the presence of nipples in men is a remnant of the female developmental stage all embryos initially undergo.","For information purposes, all eggs develop as female in the womb initially and possess nipples. However, later during the gestation period the male genes kick in, which stops the further development of female characteristics in a male fetus. It is a very typical occurrence in most of the male mammals present in the nature."
982305,why do men have nipples?,"Some of the causes for why men have nipples lie in early embryonic development. Initially, all human fetuses develop following a female blueprint, resulting in the formation of nipples. Later in gestation, male genetics activate, triggering testosterone production and halting further breast development. However, the nipples have already formed and are not subsequently eliminated. This is further supported by evolutionary biology; nipples are a common feature in nearly all male mammals, representing a sort ofgenetic backup' in the body plan. While a speculative reason is offered regarding sexual attraction, the primary cause is the initial female developmental pathway all fetuses undergo.",The occurrence of nipples in male mammals happens due to every egg starting as a the same gender in the womb with nipples and the male genes kicking in later during the gestation period.

648562,what other disease has the same characteristics of multiple sclerosis?,"For information purposes, when considering a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), clinicians must also evaluate a range of other conditions that share overlapping symptoms. These conditions, known as the differential diagnosis, include neurological disorders like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Guillain-Barr' Syndrome, as well as infections such as HIV and Syphilis. Other possibilities to consider are structural issues like Stroke, Spinal Cord Injuries, and Lumbar Disk Disorders, and systemic diseases like Sarcoidosis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Specifically, ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons, leading to paralysis. Research has linked some cases of ALS to defects in the SOD1 gene, which normally protects cells from damage. While antioxidant treatments are being investigated, the underlying causes of ALS remain complex and require further study. Additional conditions that may present similarly to MS include Beh'et disease, various brain and spinal cord tumors, hereditary ataxias, and vasculitides. Thorough evaluation is necessary to distinguish MS from these other potential causes of neurological symptoms.","For information purposes, the ""differential diagnosis"" section of the eMedicine write-up on Multiple Sclerosis explores conditions with overlapping symptoms. Some of the listed differentials include Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Bell Palsy, Guillain-Barr' Syndrome, HIV Infection and AIDS, Lumbar Disk Disorders, and Stroke. ALS, characterized by progressive motor neuron degeneration leading to paralysis and death, shares symptoms with MS. The discussion delves into the genetic aspects of ALS, highlighting the SOD1 gene's association and its role in removing harmful superoxide radicals. The link between familial ALS and chromosome 21 is noted, emphasizing the challenges in pinpointing the exact molecular cause of the disease. Current research explores antioxidant treatment for ALS, though further investigation is essential for developing promising therapies."

1758793,how does one catch a cold?,"For information purposes, a cold is contracted through the introduction of viruses or bacteria into your system. This can occur by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your face specifically your eyes or mouth after handling something with the virus or bacteria on it. Additionally, cold viruses are airborne, meaning transmission can happen simply by being in the same space as someone who is infected. Given there are over 200 different types of cold viruses, developing immunity to a significant portion of them is improbable. This explains how one catches a cold through direct contact or inhalation of the virus.","Cold viruses can be transmitted by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and subsequently touching your mouth or eyes. Given the existence of over 200 types of colds, it's unlikely to be immune to all of them. Additionally, the cold virus can also be contracted through the air, making it possible to catch it in places where the virus is present, especially if someone nearby is infected. Taking precautions, such as hand hygiene and avoiding touching the face, can help reduce the risk of transmission."
4452036,I've had my first period when I was 15 and have never had it since then. Is there an alternative to the pill?,"For information purposes, disruptions to menstruation can stem from various factors. Hormonal birth control methods, such as Depo Provera and the pill, can significantly delay the return of regular menstrual cycles after discontinuation potentially taking up to two years for the body to re-establish its natural rhythm. Additionally, missed or absent periods (amenorrhea) can be a symptom of underlying medical conditions including glandular malfunctions, chronic diseases like diabetes, metabolic disorders, or, rarely, tumors. While hormonal treatment is often used to regulate cycles once more serious causes are ruled out, amenorrhea can also be linked to emotional distress. It's important to note that early menopause can also cause irregular or absent periods. If menstruation does not resume or become regular, consulting a physician or gynecologist is crucial to investigate potential causes and receive appropriate guidance. Resources like eMedicine's Patient Education Center ([http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/53430-6.asp](http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/53430-6.asp)) offer further information on self-care options.","Early menopause is sometimes overlooked as a cause for missed periods, and birth control pills can also lead to frequent missed periods. It's advised to consult a Physician/Gynecologist to rule out the possibility of a tumor, as amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) can result from various factors, including glandular malfunction, chronic diseases, metabolic disorders like diabetes and obesity, malnutrition, and tumors. Emotional distress, such as an unhappy love affair or divorce, can also contribute to neurosis, affecting menstrual cycles. Hormonal treatment is commonly used once the possibility of a tumor is ruled out, and neurotic disorders may require psychiatric help. The effectiveness of medical help varies depending on the underlying issue, with some cases being completely curable, while for others, medical assistance may be limited."
4452036,I've had my first period when I was 15 and have never had it since then. Is there an alternative to the pill?,"It is suggested that if you've experienced a prolonged absence of menstruation following discontinuation of hormonal birth control like Depo Provera or the pill, patience is key, as it can take up to two years for your body to re-establish a regular cycle. However, given your history of never having a regular period after your first at age 15, it is strongly recommended you consult a physician or gynecologist to rule out underlying medical causes, such as the possibility of a tumor. While hormonal imbalances and emotional distress can contribute to irregular or absent periods, a thorough medical evaluation is crucial. Should a tumor be ruled out, hormonal treatment may be considered, and exploring self-care options resources like eMedicine's Patient Education Center (http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/53430-6.asp) could be beneficial.

4452036,I've had my first period when I was 15 and have never had it since then. Is there an alternative to the pill?,"In my experience, Depo Provera similar to the pill really disrupted my cycle. I first started using it at 15 and it took almost a full year for my period to return when I stopped after two years. I tried it again a few years later, and even after being off of it for over a year now, my periods *still* haven't become regular. My doctor explained it can take up to two years for your body to readjust after hormonal birth control. It's frustrating, and you really have to be patient while things try to balance out. I also read that missing periods can have a lot of different causes, and it's good to get checked out by a doctor to rule out anything serious like a tumor. It sounds scary, but it's important to know what's going on.

633761,why isn't it that there so many hiv aids victim get from blood transmissions?,"For information purposes, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) remain serious, potentially fatal diseases, but advancements in medical treatment have significantly improved management and prognosis compared to two decades ago. While there is currently no vaccine or cure, medications like protease inhibitors and antibiotics for opportunistic infections effectively manage the disease's progression. HIV's difficulty to cure stems from its rapid mutation rate, hindering the development of broadly effective antiviral drugs, and its ability to integrate and hide within the body's own white blood cells. Healthcare professionals face potential exposure risk during patient care, but protocols exist involving immediate (within one hour) and prolonged (up to six months) medication that *may* prevent infection following a potential exposure. Blood donation screening processes are rigorous, ensuring donors are at no risk for HIV and testing all donations for bloodborne diseases. This explains why blood transmission rates are low, addressing the question of why widespread transmission via blood supply doesn't occur. Importantly, diagnosis often occurs later in the illness, further complicating treatment efforts.","While there is no vaccine or cure for HIV/AIDS, medical advancements have significantly improved the treatment and management of the disease. Unlike two decades ago, it is no longer an absolute death sentence. Protease inhibitors and potent antibiotics for opportunistic infections have transformed the way the disease is handled in patients. Regarding blood donation, individuals must be at no risk of having the disease and undergo testing to ensure the absence of bloodborne infections. Healthcare professionals, exposed to potential HIV transmission during patient care, follow a protocol involving immediate medication after possible exposure for up to six months, which may prevent the disease. Due to the virus's constant mutation, designing a universal drug effective against all variants is challenging. Additionally, the virus can ""hide"" within the body's white blood cells, complicating treatment efforts."
4372946,Will you get a rash if you take Lamictal and Depakene concurrently?,"For information purposes, Lamictal (lamotrigine) is associated with a potential side effect of skin rash, particularly when the dosage is increased too rapidly. Healthcare providers typically initiate treatment with a low dose and gradually increase it to minimize this risk. Depakene/Depakote (valproic acid) is a commonly prescribed medication, and generally well-tolerated by many patients. Based on clinical experience, a rash experienced while taking these medications is most likely attributable to a too-quick titration of Lamictal. Regarding concurrent use, the provided information does *not* directly address whether taking Lamictal and Depakene together increases the risk of rash. It focuses on Lamictal dosage as the primary factor.","Lamictal can cause a rash if taken at too high of a dose too quickly. Many doctors reportedly start patients on small doses and gradually increase them to a therapeutic level. Depakene/Depakote is mentioned as a common medication that many people take without problems. If a rash is present, the message speculates that it might be due to a too-rapid increase in the dose of Lamictal."
4372946,Will you get a rash if you take Lamictal and Depakene concurrently?,"In my experience as a psychiatric nurse, I've seen firsthand how Lamictal can sometimes cause a rash, and it's usually linked to the dosage being increased too rapidly. It's common practice to start patients on a very low dose and slowly build it up to avoid that reaction. Depakene (or Depakote) is a medication many people use successfully without issue. Based on what I've observed, if someone *does* develop a rash while on these medications, my first thought is often that it's related to the Lamictal dose being escalated too quickly it's a pattern I've encountered many times. While the question asks about taking both Lamictal and Depakene together, my experience centers on the rash being specifically tied to *how* Lamictal is introduced, rather than a direct interaction with Depakene.","In users expereince, one psych nurse dealt with many medications like those."
3379098,"Why was Eric, the Phantom of the Opera so thin, ugly and smelt of death and had yellow eyes? Some disease?","For information purposes, Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) is a group of inherited disorders affecting the liver and bile flow. The term breaks down as follows:Progressive' indicates worsening over time,Familial' signifies a genetic component,Intrahepatic' means the disease occurs *within* the liver itself, andCholestasis' refers to the impaired flow of bile, leading to a buildup of substances within the liver.PFIC typically presents in early childhood, often around 3 months of age, though onset can occur later, even in adolescence or adulthood. The condition can progress rapidly to liver scarring (cirrhosis) or more slowly. A primary symptom is intense itching (pruritus), often disproportionate to the degree of jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). This scratching can cause bleeding and scarring, impacting daily life and development. Growth problems are common, with most patients being shorter than their peers, and delayed puberty is frequently observed. Other potential issues include frequent nosebleeds, wheezing, and deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, D, and K), which can lead to vision problems, neurological issues, bone abnormalities, and bleeding disorders. Some patients may also develop gallstones or an enlarged liver or spleen.There are different subtypes of PFIC (PFIC1, PFIC2/BSEP, and PFIC3/MDR3), each with varying degrees of severity and specific characteristics. Research is ongoing to better understand these differences.Regarding the associated question aboutThe Phantom of the Opera,' the described symptoms thinness, disfigurement, a sickly odor, and yellow eyes *could* be consistent with a severe, untreated case of PFIC, or another chronic liver disease causing cholestasis. However, this is speculative and based solely on the described symptoms.","Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC) is a genetic disorder characterized by worsening cholestasis, a condition involving poor bile flow and the accumulation of substances in the liver. PFIC can be categorized as low-GGT PFIC when associated with FIC1 and BSEP diseases, leading to symptoms such as jaundice, itching (pruritus), and liver scarring (cirrhosis). Onset typically occurs in early childhood but can manifest later into adolescence or adulthood. Itching, often disproportionate to jaundice levels, is a prominent symptom and may be resistant to medications. Growth issues, delayed puberty, frequent nosebleeds, and vitamin deficiencies are common. Patients may also experience gallstones, an enlarged liver, and spleen. PFIC3, now referred to as MDR3 disease, involves severe cholestasis in early life and may progress to liver dysfunction. Variations in symptoms exist between FIC1 disease and BSEP disease, and MDR3 disease may present with milder forms. The understanding of these disorders is evolving as more patients are studied."
1811611,How do you overcome panic attacks? I've struggled with them for years.?,"For information purposes, panic attacks are frightening and disabling episodes characterized by biological overreactions. Understanding this'that they are not reflective of one's character'can be a key step in managing them, as demonstrated by the benefit some individuals find in learning about abnormal psychology. Treatment approaches vary depending on the frequency and severity of attacks. Common methods include psychological therapies like relaxation training and exposure therapy, which aim to help individuals recognize and work through attacks to reduce their occurrence. Medication, such as antidepressants (Fluoxetine, venlafaxine), may be used if therapies are insufficient or attacks are severe, though benzodiazepines are generally discouraged due to potential for habit formation.Alongside professional help, several self-management strategies are suggested. These include lifestyle adjustments like eliminating caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine, and incorporating regular, vigorous exercise particularly swimming to improve cardiovascular health and reduce physical sensations associated with panic. Relaxation techniques such as meditation, yoga, and creating a calming environment are also beneficial. During an attack, repeating calming affirmations (""Everything is fine, it's just a panic attack"") while practicing deep, controlled breathing (4-5 second inhale, hold, exhale sequence) can help regulate heart rate and restore rationality. Exploring potential dietary factors and seeking therapy to address the underlying causes of anxiety are also recommended. Resources like Louise Hay'sSelf-Esteem Affirmations,' Susan Jeffers'Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway,' andNatural Relief for Anxiety' offer further support and strategies.","Panic attacks are highly distressing and potentially disabling, with overcoming methods depending on factors like frequency, disruption to life, and specific triggers. Psychological therapies, such as relaxation training and Exposure and Response Prevention, aim to recognize and address panic attacks, reducing their frequency over time. Medications like antidepressants (e.g., Fluoxetine, venlafaxine) are used if psychological therapies prove ineffective or for severe cases. A technique involving repeating ""I'll Handle It"" is suggested during panic attacks. Additionally, regular vigorous exercise is noted as an effective way to clear the mind and strengthen mental well-being."
1811611,How do you overcome panic attacks? I've struggled with them for years.?,"It is suggested that a multi-faceted approach is most effective in overcoming panic attacks. Firstly, seeking professional guidance from a psychiatrist or psychologist is recommended to identify underlying causes. However, before or alongside medical intervention, several self-help strategies are advised. These include eliminating stimulants like caffeine, alcohol, and cigarettes, and incorporating vigorous, regular exercise particularly swimming into your routine. Daily relaxation techniques, such as yoga, meditation, and mindful rest, are also strongly encouraged. During a panic attack, it's recommended to practice deep, controlled breathing (inhaling for 4-5 seconds, holding, and exhaling for the same duration, repeated 20 times) while repeatedly affirming that the attack is temporary and manageable (""Everything is fine, it's just a panic attack' it will pass""). Further support can be found through self-education understanding panic attacks as biological responses and resources like Louise Hay'sSelf-Esteem Affirmations' and Susan Jeffers'Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway.' Additionally, exploring complementary strategies outlined inNatural Relief for Anxiety' may prove beneficial, including dietary adjustments and potential vitamin supplementation. While medication may be considered, it's advised to prioritize natural strategies and be cautious of potentially habit-forming benzodiazepines.

4327181,Why are you even more tired after you get too much sleep?,"For information purposes, feeling more tired after excessive sleep can be explained by the natural progression through sleep stages. During sleep, individuals cycle through stages 1, 2, 3, 4, and REM sleep, repeating these cycles throughout the night. Stages 3 and 4 represent the deepest phases of sleep, characterized by delta brain wave activity. Being awakened *from* these deep sleep stages can result in a feeling of grogginess and increased fatigue often described as beingcranky' or more tired than before waking. This is because the brain hasn't fully completed its restorative processes when interrupted from deep sleep.","For information purposes, due to our sleep stages, individuals go through a cycle that includes stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, stage 4, and REM (rapid eye movement). The deepest sleep, occurring during stages 3 and 4, is interrupted by periods of REM and stage 2. At times, individuals may return to the deep sleep stages after an extended period, particularly if they sleep for an extended duration. However, being awakened during the deepest sleep, characterized by delta brain waves, can result in a feeling of crankiness or increased fatigue upon waking. This suggests a correlation between the sleep cycle stages and the impact of waking during the deepest sleep on morning mood and alertness."

It develops when the adrenal glands, located above the kidneys, do not produce sufficient cortisol, and sometimes aldosterone. Specifically, Addison's disease refers to *primary* adrenal insufficiency, a malfunction of the adrenal glands themselves, while *secondary* adrenal insufficiency stems from insufficient ACTH production by the pituitary gland. The disease presents with symptoms including fatigue, muscle weakness, weight loss, low blood pressure, and potentially a bronzelike darkening of the skin. It can occur in all age groups and affects men and women equally. The most frequent cause is autoimmune, where the body attacks its own adrenal glands. Treatment involves hormone replacement therapy, typically through medications like hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.","For information purposes, addison's disease, also known as chronic adrenal insufficiency or hypocortisolism, is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by a malfunction of the adrenal glands.

1264745,how many times can a person go through Defibrillation?,"For information purposes, this text addresses concerns about defibrillation and cardiac arrest, specifically in relation to the question of how many times a person can undergo the procedure. It clarifies that defibrillation itself is generally less concerning than the underlying heart condition *causing* the need for it viewing it as ajump start' for a weakened heart. The text highlights that a hospital setting offers a neurologically superior environment for resuscitation ('coding') compared to an out-of-hospital situation, due to quicker access to a code team and better brain perfusion with oxygenated blood. It notes a typical hospital protocol of limiting shocks to three at a specific energy level (400 joules) before considering alternative interventions.Regarding the number of shocks delivered, automated external defibrillators (AEDs) commonly found in homes and sports facilities are computer-controlled and will continue to deliver shocks, escalating the energy level to the maximum, until heart activity is detected. This contrasts with the more limited hospital protocol.","For information purposes, the number of times a person can undergo defibrillation depends on the situation and the presence of medical professionals. In a hospital setting, defibrillation is typically attempted up to three times at 400 joules if there's no response. If there's still no heart activity after the third attempt, further shocks may not be administered. In a home or sport defibrillator scenario, the machine is computer-controlled and shocks until there is confirmation of heart activity or until the maximum preset number of shocks is reached. However, it's essential to prioritize addressing the underlying cause of cardiac arrest, as frequent defibrillation attempts may not be as critical as addressing the heart's overall condition, which is more concerning in the long term."

3352492,What is the normal TSH range for thyroid function?,"For information purposes, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is a key indicator of thyroid function. TSH is secreted by the body to regulate levels of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. A normal TSH range is generally considered to be 0.200-5.5, with values above 5.5 suggesting potential underactivity of the thyroid (hypothyroidism) and lower values potentially indicating overactivity. However, the upper limit ofnormal' has shifted over time, and many experts now recommend maintaining a TSH level below 2.0. It's important to note that iodine deficiency is prevalent in areas of the United States, historically known as thegoiter belt' (between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains), due to depleted iodine levels in the soil. While iodine was once supplemented in salt and other foods, those levels have decreased. Some individuals find benefit from potassium-iodine supplementation, mirroring typical iodine intake in iodine-rich diets like those in Japan.","For information purposes, the typical range for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is 0.2-5.5, where a higher number suggests an overactive thyroid and a lower number indicates an underactive one. TSH is released in response to the levels of T3 and T4 hormones from the thyroid gland. The accepted range for a healthy thyroid has changed over time. Contrary to a previous assertion, 0.2 is considered the appropriate TSH measurement for a normally functioning thyroid. The upper limit, indicative of low thyroid function (hypothyroidism), has varied from 4 to 5.5 across different periods. It's crucial for individuals to seek guidance from healthcare professionals for personalized interpretation and advice regarding their thyroid function test results."
3352492,What is the normal TSH range for thyroid function?,"In my experience, navigating thyroid health has been a journey of understanding shifting standards and taking proactive steps. For years, my TSH levels which measure how your body regulates thyroid hormones have been monitored, and thenormal' range has seemed to creep upwards. While traditionally a TSH of 0.2 was considered ideal, the upper limit for what's considered *not* underactive has floated between 4 and 5.5. Personally, I've found that even 5.5 feels quite high, suggesting a sluggish metabolism. What really struck me in my research is learning about iodine deficiency in this country. Apparently, the soil in a large swath of the US is depleted of iodine, leading to widespread issues in the past even earning the area the nicknamethe goiter belt.' Because of this, I've begun supplementing with a higher dose of potassium-iodine, mirroring the amounts commonly consumed in Japan, and I've noticed a real positive difference in both my thyroid function and my overall metabolism. It's been about finding what works for *my* body, beyond just fitting within a standard range.","Anindividual has personally undergone thyroid function measurement and notes that a TSH level of 5.5 is considered high, indicating a potentially low metabolism. According to various experts, the TSH level is suggested to be below 2 for optimal thyroid function. They highlight living in a region with iodine deficiency, particularly between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians, where iodine in the soil was depleted after the last ice age. Historical outbreaks of goiter in the early 1900s led to the region being called the ""goiter belt,"" prompting the addition of iodine to salt and its use in bread and food dye. Although iodine levels in salt have been reduced over time, the individual reports positive results in thyroid and metabolism by using a relatively high dosage potassium-iodine supplement, similar to the daily intake in the Japanese diet."
1302854,Why do we have nose hairs and buggers?,"For information purposes, the human nose employs two key mechanisms for filtering inhaled air and protecting the body from harmful particles. Nasal passages are lined with hairs that act as a first line of defense, physically trapping dust and other airborne particles. Additionally, mucus commonly referred to assnot' orbuggers' serves as a secondary defense, capturing and removing these trapped particles from the body. Essentially,buggers' are composed of accumulated dust and inhaled debris that the body expels to maintain respiratory health. This system answers the question of why we have nose hairs and buggers: they are both integral components of the body's natural filtration and defense system against inhaled pollutants.","Nose hairs serve as a defense mechanism by filtering out harmful particles from the air we breathe, preventing them from entering our bodies.

4309945,What is the average I.Q? How much is the maximum? And the Lowest?,"For information purposes, this text provides details regarding intelligence quotient (IQ) scores and their interpretation. The average IQ is generally considered to be between 100-110, with most US-based tests setting the average at 100. A score below 75 is clinically defined as indicating intellectual disability. Individuals scoring between 140-150 demonstrate very good problem-solving skills, and scores of 140 and above may be considered genius level. Historically, a score of 150 was a requirement for MENSA membership, though this may have increased. It's important to note that IQ test results can vary by approximately 15 points depending on the test administered. The text also indicates IQ scores between the US and France are generally comparable, and provides a link for further international comparisons.**Addressing the associated questions:***   **Average IQ:** 100-110 (depending on the testing standard)*   **Maximum IQ:** The text suggests 140 and above is considered genius, with MENSA historically requiring 150 (potentially higher now). There isn't a definedmaximum' but scores significantly above 160 are rare.*   **Lowest IQ:** Below 75 is clinically defined as intellectual disability.","IQ scores are typically standardized to have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The majority of people (about 68%) fall within one standard deviation of the mean, which means they have an IQ between 85 and 115. A score of 100 is considered average, and scores above or below that indicate deviation from the average. While an IQ of 140-150 is generally considered very high, it's important to note that IQ alone doesn't encompass all aspects of intelligence, and there are various types of intelligence that go beyond what traditional IQ tests measure. Additionally, the interpretation of IQ scores can vary, and different countries may use slightly different scales."
4309945,What is the average I.Q? How much is the maximum? And the Lowest?,"In my experience, understanding IQ scores has always been a bit nuanced. I personally took an IQ test and scored 147, though I understand those numbers can shift a difference of around 15 points isn't unusual depending on the test itself. It's interesting to think about howaverage' is defined too; here in the US, it's set at 100, while generally people consider an IQ of 100-110 as typical. I remember learning that anything below 75 is considered clinically mentally disabled, and that Mensa used to require a score of 150 though I believe that's even higher now. Scores of 140 and above definitely feel like you're operating at a very high level of problem-solving ability, and some even call that genius level. It really highlights how these scores are just one way to look at intelligence, and can vary a bit depending on where you are in the world.","In users expereince, one individual had an IQ of 147."

577269,Why am I always tired?,"For information purposes, fatigue a lack of energy and motivation distinct from simply feeling sleepy can stem from various sources. It may be a normal response to exertion, stress, or lack of sleep, but persistent fatigue warrants medical evaluation as it can indicate an underlying physical or psychological disorder. Potential causes include thyroid issues, sleep disorders (like sleep apnea, indicated by snoring), and existing illnesses. Diagnostic tests for thyroid function and a sleep study may be recommended by a doctor. It's crucial to inform your physician of *all* supplements and vitamins you are taking, as interactions with medications (like Warfarin and Vitamin K) can occur. Additionally, workplace factors can contribute to fatigue. Some individuals may benefit from B-12 supplementation, particularly if anemic, though B-12 shots may be more effective. A diet rich in protein and iron is also important, especially if low iron levels are suspected. However, vitamin supplementation should be discussed with a doctor, especially when an underlying illness is present. Determining what is *not* causing the fatigue can help pinpoint the root cause.","Fatigue is different from drowsiness. In general, drowsiness is feeling the need to sleep, while fatigue is a lack of energy and motivation. Drowsiness and apathy (a feeling of indifference or not caring about what happens) can be symptoms of fatigue.Fatigue can be a normal and important response to physical exertion, emotional stress, boredom, or lack of sleep. However, it can also be a nonspecific sign of a more serious psychological or physical disorder. Fatigue that is not relieved by enough sleep, good nutrition, or a low-stress environment should be evaluated by your doctor. Because fatigue is a common complaint, sometimes a potentially serious cause may be overlooked.The pattern of fatigue may help your doctor determine its underlying cause. For example, if you wake up in the morning rested but rapidly develop fatigue with activity, you may have an ongoing physical condition like an underactive thyroid"
577269,Why am I always tired?,"Some of the causes of persistent fatigue are varied and can stem from both physical and psychological sources. Initially, a condition like mononucleosis ('mono') could be responsible. However, more broadly, fatigue can result from underlying illnesses, including thyroid dysfunction, or disruptions to sleep such as snoring which may indicate a need for a sleep study. Emotional stress, boredom, or simply a lack of sleep are also potential causes. Additionally, nutritional deficiencies, specifically low levels of vitamin B-12, iron, and protein, can contribute to feelings of fatigue and even anemia. Finally, environmental factors, like workplace conditions, may also be responsible for lethargy. It's important to note that fatigue can be a symptom of a more serious, undiagnosed condition, and interactions between medications and vitamins (like Warfarin and Vitamin K) can also induce fatigue, highlighting the need for medical evaluation.","Fatigue may be due to anemia, low iron, or depression."
577269,Why am I always tired?,"It is suggested that you may be experiencing mononucleosis (""mono"") and should consider incorporating exercise into your routine.

1156784,If u take tylenol every day will it become inaffective?,"For information purposes, frequent and long-term Tylenol (acetaminophen) use can lead to several health-related issues. The content highlights the potential for developing a physical dependence on the medication, similar to other drugs, particularly with high dosages (up to 10 pills at a time were mentioned). This dependence can manifest as withdrawal symptoms upon cessation. Furthermore, the body can build a tolerance, meaning the medication becomes less effective over time, potentially requiring increased dosages as illustrated by a case where escalating Tylenol use failed to manage pain and led to a switch to stronger pain medication. Ultimately, consistent daily use increases the risk of both dependence *and* diminished effectiveness.","If you take Tylenol every day, your body might get used to it, and it might not work as well. Also, you could become addicted to it, like with other drugs."

She relied on it for nearly her whole life, eventually taking as many as ten pills at once just to manage foot pain. It didn't even help her pain, and ultimately she needed to be switched to *stronger* medication. Now, she's going through really difficult withdrawal symptoms trying to get off of it. It's been a scary experience seeing how her body has become so reliant on the drug, and it really highlighted to me how easily you can become addicted, just like with any other medication. I've learned that if you take it regularly, your body can build up a tolerance, making it less effective, and stopping can lead to feeling quite sick even sicker than before. It definitely makes me think twice about using it daily.","Taking Tylenol every day for a long time may make it less effective, One users grandma used to take a lot of Tylenol, but it didn't help her foot pain, so she had to switch to stronger pain meds."

495757,what time of the month can a woman get pregnant?,"For information purposes, a woman can potentially get pregnant at any point during her menstrual cycle, though the likelihood varies. While it was previously believed pregnancy couldn't occur during menstruation, this is inaccurate. The period around ovulation approximately day 14 of a 28-day cycle (counting from the first day of menstruation), with a higher risk window spanning days 12-18 represents the most fertile time due to the presence of viable sperm for several days. Generally, the two weeks before and after a period (if regular) also carry a risk. Irregular cycles may require monitoring basal body temperature to identify ovulation. Increased libido can also be an indicator of heightened fertility due to hormonal changes. It's important to note that no birth control method is foolproof except abstinence. Condom use is strongly recommended to prevent pregnancy.","Pregnancy can happen at any time of the month, but the week before, during, and after menstruation is considered more likely, especially during. No birth control method is 100% effective except abstinence. It used to be thought that pregnancy couldn't occur during menstruation, which is not true. Unusually high libido may indicate hormonal changes favoring fertility. Approximately two weeks before and after a regular period, especially around day 14 (with day 1 being the first day of the period), is considered a high probability time for conception. However, any time of the month is possible, so relying solely on timing for birth control is not recommended. Day 12-18 poses a higher risk due to the viability of sperm lasting a few days. Temperature measurement or other methods can be used to track ovulation for more accurate predictions."

4278766,Is there anyone who gained weight from the depo shot and pregnancy?,"For information purposes, the Depo-Provera shot (depo shot) is associated with several potential side effects. A key concern reported is weight gain, believed to be linked to hormonal changes induced by the medication, and this weight gain may persist even after discontinuing the shot. Other side effects include irregular spotting or bleeding. Furthermore, it can take 12-18 months for fertility to return after stopping Depo-Provera. Experiences shared indicate significant weight gain ranging from 35 to 44 pounds during use of the shot. While some individuals return to their pre-Depo weight after stopping, this is not always the case, and weight loss can be challenging even with interventions like prescription medication. It's important to note that individual experiences vary, and other factors, such as age-related metabolic changes, may also contribute to weight fluctuations. Alternative long-term birth control options, such as intrauterine devices (IUDs), are presented as potentially more effective and without the reported weight gain side effect.","For information purposes, the Depo shot is associated with numerous side effects, and weight gain is attributed to specific hormones in the shot. Individuals using the Depo shot may experience ongoing weight gain as long as they are on the medication. Additionally, the weight-related effects are suggested to have a genetic component, indicating that individual responses to the shot may vary based on genetic factors."
4278766,Is there anyone who gained weight from the depo shot and pregnancy?,"It is suggested that individuals considering or currently using the Depo-Provera shot carefully weigh the potential side effects, particularly concerning weight gain, before continuing. Based on reported experiences, the hormonal changes induced by the shot can lead to significant weight gain during use, and this weight may not easily resolve after discontinuation even post-pregnancy. Furthermore, spotting and a potentially extended return to fertility (12-18 months) are also noted concerns. As a more effective, long-term alternative with fewer reported side effects, an IUD is recommended. If weight gain is a concern, exploring other birth control options is advisable, and consulting with a doctor regarding metabolic changes or potential weight management solutions may be beneficial.","It is suggested that the Depo shot be avoided due to several drawbacks, including issues such as weight gain, spotting, and a prolonged period of infertility (12 to 18 months) once one decides to discontinue the shot. Instead, the recommendation is to consider alternative long-term birth control methods. Specifically, it is suggested to opt for the intrauterine device (IUD), which is deemed more effective, has a longer duration of effectiveness (up to 5 years when inserted), and lacks the weight-gaining side effect associated with the Depo shot."
4278766,Is there anyone who gained weight from the depo shot and pregnancy?,"In my experience, the Depo shot led to significant and lasting weight gain. After having my son and returning to my pre-pregnancy weight, I was on Depo for three years and gained 44 pounds. Unlike what I was told, the weight hasn't come off easily even after stopping the shot I'm now 21 and even with the help of a weight loss medication like phentermine, it's been a struggle. I've also heard about a friend who had a really tough time with 35 pounds of weight gain and months of spotting while on Depo, which solidified my decision to avoid it. Because of the weight gain, spotting, and the potential for a long wait to conceive after stopping potentially 12 to 18 months I personally wouldn't recommend it. I think an IUD is a better long-term option, as it's effective and doesn't seem to carry the same side effects.","Multiple individuals share their experiences with weight-related issues and hormonal treatments. One person expresses concern about the side effects of a hormonal treatment, citing a friend who gained 35 pounds and experienced continuous spotting for four months. Despite this, the individual decided against using the treatment. Another individual shares a different experience, noting a weight gain of about 44 pounds during three years on the Depo shot. Contrary to expectations, the weight did not easily come off after discontinuing the treatment. A third individual discusses their use of the prescription weight loss drug phentermine, which has been effective but is not considered a permanent solution. The individual's doctor suggests that changes in metabolism with age might be contributing to weight-related challenges, emphasizing that weight gain can sometimes occur for unknown reasons."

Given the complexities related to cancer diagnosis and treatment stage, **consulting with a local life insurance agent is strongly recommended**. Be completely transparent with the agent and underwriter regarding medical history to avoid potential claim denials. To maximize potential benefits, **obtaining quotes from multiple (4-5) insurance companies is advisable**, as policies geared towards individuals with limited life expectancy typically offer smaller payouts (around $20,000). Be aware that policies held for shorter durations less than two years may have limited returns, generally offering a small lump sum plus the total premiums paid. These policies are often the only available option due to their structure, where no refund of premiums is due upon cancellation without a death claim. This approach can potentially generate enough funds (around $10,000 across multiple policies) to cover burial expenses.","The advice given suggests buying term life insurance, specifically multiple policies, if the person is expected to die. The recommendation is to obtain about 4 or 5 different policies, as they pay relatively low amounts (e.g., 20 grand if the person dies). If the person dies within two years, the payout is calculated based on the premiums paid. The suggestion is to purchase multiple policies to accumulate enough funds for burial expenses. The recommendation also emphasizes honesty with the life insurance agent to avoid denial of payout later. It's advised to consult with a local life insurance agent for personalized assistance."

65934,WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE SENSETIVE TO CAFFIENE AND OTHERS ARE NOT?,"For information purposes, individual sensitivity to caffeine varies due to differing internal chemical balances. This means people can experience caffeine's effects or lack thereof in different ways. Furthermore, caffeine tolerance is a factor; regular consumption leads to a decreased response over time, while reducing intake can heighten sensitivity. Dietary habits also play a role, as consistent intake of caffeine-containing foods can cause the body to adjust. A self-experiment involving a two-week abstinence from highly caffeinated beverages, followed by reintroduction, may demonstrate a noticeable increase in caffeine's effects, illustrating this principle of tolerance and individual response. This explains why some individuals are more sensitive to caffeine than others.","Individuals exhibit diverse responses to caffeine due to variations in their chemical makeup. The effects are contingent on factors like individual tolerance levels, where increased consumption diminishes its impact, and reduced intake heightens sensitivity. Dietary habits also influence reactions to caffeine; consistent consumption leads to gradual adjustments.

This break is anticipated to accentuate the effects, underscoring the personalized nature of caffeine sensitivity."
189695,When I floss.. I bleed sometimes.. Why?,"For information purposes, bleeding gums can indicate several oral health issues. The most common condition is **gingivitis**, an inflammation of the gums often caused by insufficient flossing. While frequent bleeding, especially in those who don't floss regularly, can be a normal response to introducing flossing, *any* bleeding gums are not considered healthy. More seriously, bleeding gums can also be a sign of **periodontal disease**, which requires professional dental intervention. Home care, such as daily gargling with warm salt water, may help toughen gums. However, it's crucial to consult a dentist for diagnosis and treatment, as they can recommend appropriate oral rinses or other therapies to manage the condition and prevent it from worsening. Ultimately, bleeding during flossing signals a need to address gum health, either through improved oral hygiene or professional dental care.","""Gingivitis"" is a condition where the gums are not at their healthiest, often caused by inadequate flossing. It is a common issue, and bleeding gums are not considered normal. Regular oral hygiene practices, including flossing, are essential for maintaining gum health."

Why?,"Some of the causes of bleeding gums, and potentially gingivitis or periodontal disease, are insufficient flossing bleeding is common in people who don't floss regularly. Conversely, flossing *too* hard can also irritate the gums and cause bleeding. Ultimately, bleeding gums are not normal and can indicate unhealthy gums, potentially leading to more serious periodontal disease requiring professional dental intervention and treatment like medicated oral rinses. While a temporary remedy like warm salt water gargles may help toughen gums, a dentist should be consulted to determine the underlying cause and appropriate course of action.","If your gums bleed, it could be a sign of gingivitis, indicating either unhealthy gums or flossing too hard. It might also suggest periodontal disease, especially if you don't floss regularly. Bleeding is common for those who infrequently floss, and it's possible that flossing too hard could contribute to the issue."
189695,When I floss.. I bleed sometimes.. Why?,"It is suggested that bleeding gums when flossing may indicate gingivitis, a common condition stemming from insufficient flossing or, conversely, flossing too aggressively. To address this, consider incorporating a daily warm salt water gargle for a month to strengthen gum tissue. However, persistent bleeding is *not* normal and could signal periodontal disease, requiring professional evaluation and treatment from a dentist. We recommend scheduling an appointment with your dentist to determine the underlying cause and receive appropriate guidance, potentially including prescription oral rinses, to regain gum health. Consistent, gentle flossing is key, and if bleeding continues despite improved technique, professional intervention is strongly advised.","If your gums bleed, don't panic; consult your dentist for advice on how to address the issue.

Certain antidepressants are more likely to cause withdrawal effects upon discontinuation, including Paxil, Effexor, and Lexapro. Conversely, Prozac, Luvox, Celexa, Zoloft, and Cymbalta are less frequently associated with withdrawal. The individual sharing this information experienced significant withdrawal symptoms lasting up to three months including nightmares, night sweats, and skin breakouts after stopping an unspecified antidepressant. They strongly advise against taking these medications if possible, suggesting alternative coping mechanisms for depression like exercise and social support. The text also highlights a concern regarding physician awareness of antidepressant pharmacology and the importance of *tapering* off medications gradually after prolonged use to minimize potential withdrawal effects. It expresses a concern that antidepressants are sometimes overprescribed. Further research via resources like library books on psychiatric medications is recommended.","Many medications, including antidepressants, often require gradual tapering to minimize withdrawal effects. Some doctors may not fully understand the pharmacology of these drugs. Some medications can be risky and should only be used when necessary, but they are sometimes overprescribed like Valium."
1154853,Anyone suffering from withdrawal from anti depressant medications?,"It is suggested that individuals considering or currently taking antidepressant medication be aware of potential withdrawal symptoms, particularly when discontinuing use. While not all antidepressants cause withdrawal, those with a higher risk include Paxil, Effexor, and Lexapro. Conversely, Prozac, Luvox, Celexa, Zoloft, and Cymbalta may be less likely to induce withdrawal. We recommend researching psychiatric medications thoroughly utilizing library resources is a good starting point to understand potential side effects and withdrawal experiences. Importantly, a gradual tapering off of most antidepressants, when discontinuing, is strongly advised. Furthermore, it is recommended to discuss the necessity of medication with your doctor, as some may be overprescribed, and to explore alternative coping mechanisms for depression, such as exercise or social support, when appropriate. If experiencing difficult withdrawal symptoms, seeking medical guidance is essential.","Some antidepressant medications, like Paxil, Effexor, and Lexapro, may cause withdrawal symptoms, while others like Prozac, Luvox, Celexa, Zoloft, and Cymbalta generally do not.

In times of depression, alternatives such as going to the gym or contacting a friend for support can be helpful."
1154853,Anyone suffering from withdrawal from anti depressant medications?,"In my experience, navigating antidepressants has been a real journey, and a surprisingly isolating one when it came to understanding withdrawal. I've tried several, and learned the hard way that not all cause discontinuation syndrome. Paxil, Effexor, and Lexapro *did* for me, while Prozac, Luvox, Celexa, Zoloft, and Cymbalta didn't. But what really struck me is how little doctors seem to warn you about this. My withdrawal from one of those medications was truly awful lasting up to three months with vivid, terrifying nightmares, waking up screaming, drenching night sweats that required changing clothes multiple times, and even skin breakouts. It was so bad, I've vowed to never go back on them. Now, if I'm feeling down, I focus on things like exercise or connecting with friends instead. It's also concerning how casually these medications are prescribed, almost like a quick fix, and how often doctors don't fully grasp the pharmacology of what they're giving patients tapering is *essential*, yet often overlooked. It feels like they've become overused, similar to how Valium once was.","Some antidepressants, like Paxil, Effexor, and Lexapro, can cause withdrawal symptoms, including nightmares, night sweats, and skin breakouts that may last up to 3 months.

706379,"iam 23 yrs old ...and my height is 5.1,want to grow tall.. but how? want some efective ways to grow tall?","For information purposes, natural growth typically ceases around age 23 as the growth plates in long bones (metaphysis and diaphasis) fuse. While the desire to increase height is understandable, there are no completely safe and effective methods to do so after this point. Attempts to artificially increase height, such as through Human Growth Hormone (HGH) historically experimented with by Russian athletes carry significant health risks, including potential fatality and disfigurement. Height is largely determined by genetics; individuals with shorter parents are more likely to be shorter themselves. While activities like swimming and basketball *may* contribute to a very slight increase (potentially to 1 inch) through stretching, substantial growth is unlikely. Medical interventions (""growth medicine"") are not recommended due to lack of proven efficacy and potential harm. Ultimately, accepting one's current height is advised, as height does not equate to improved well-being or attractiveness. Many successful individuals, including those in the entertainment industry, are of shorter stature.","In the 70s and 80s, the Russians conducted experiments with human growth hormone (HGH) on Olympic athletes, resulting in varied outcomes, including growth and potential health risks. The mention of a distinct facial appearance among those subjected to these experiments reflects the extreme nature of the interventions. The subsequent explanation provides a general understanding that after a certain age, the fusion of long bone components limits the potential for significant height increase. It underscores the genetic factor in determining height and suggests engaging in certain activities like swimming or basketball for marginal height gains, with a clear note that substantial height increase is unlikely after a certain age."
706379,"iam 23 yrs old ...and my height is 5.1,want to grow tall.. but how? want some efective ways to grow tall?","It is suggested that you accept your current height and focus on self-acceptance, as natural growth is complete at age 23. While there's a desire to find effective ways to grow taller, it's strongly recommended *against* pursuing height-increasing medications due to potential serious health risks historical examples demonstrate dangerous side effects. Furthermore, attempting to grow taller at this age is unlikely to be successful due to the natural fusion of long bones and genetic predisposition. Instead, consider exploring options like heels or focusing on activities like swimming or basketball, which *may* offer a minimal increase (perhaps to 1 inch) through stretching, but shouldn't be relied upon for significant growth. Ultimately, it is advised to embrace your stature and recognize that true attractiveness lies within, not in physical height.","The advice for a 23-year-old seeking to increase height centers on self-acceptance and confidence, highlighting that the natural growth period is typically complete at this age. Emphasizing the insignificance of height in defining attractiveness, the suggestion discourages the use of medications or supplements claiming to boost height. While acknowledging anecdotal claims about certain physical activities potentially influencing height, the message humorously suggests considering heels or stilettos for personal satisfaction. Ultimately, the overarching theme is one of embracing and finding contentment with one's natural height, promoting the idea that confidence and inner qualities outweigh societal perceptions of physical stature."

The author asserts that traditional sit-ups and crunches are less effective due to insufficient resistance for substantial muscle development. They advocate for a modified push-up performed while lying prone, propping feet up, and keeping hands together a technique described as significantly more challenging and directly targeting the abdominal muscles. The author claims this exercise builds core strength to a point where the body can be lifted off the ground with legs parallel to the floor, indicating progress. While initially difficult, consistent practice (around 15-20 repetitions daily for maintenance) is believed to yield results. The content also briefly mentions the possibility of developing aneight-pack' and suggests reverse sit-ups as more effective than standard crunches, and ultimately recommends crunches as a key to achieving a six-pack. The author also details how to perform crunches and obliques. It's important to note that the information is presented anecdotally, based on the author's personal experience, and lacks scientific backing.","For information purposes, the debate over the effectiveness of reverse sit-ups versus traditional sit-ups centers on the goal of achieving a six-pack. Some argue that reverse sit-ups are more effective, emphasizing the need for resistance to build larger abdominal muscles. Others contend that traditional sit-ups, when performed correctly, can contribute to core strength. However, the notion that sit-ups alone are a waste of time for revealing a six-pack highlights the importance of combining abdominal exercises with an overall fitness strategy, including resistance training, cardiovascular exercise, and a healthy diet, to address both muscle development and body fat reduction."

Regarding exercise, the text strongly discourages fixed routines and prolonged workouts (over 45 minutes) as they can lead to muscle breakdown and overtraining. Instead, it advocates forshocking' the muscles through varied methods like altering exercise order, speed, utilizing supersets, giant sets, negatives, and stripping sets. Optimal muscle building, according to this information, requires a specific dietary approach: palm-sized protein portions every 3 hours (excluding 3 hours before bed), two clenched fists of carbohydrates, and limited healthy fats (olive/flaxseed oils, nuts) per meal. Adequate rest at least 8 hours of sleep and post-workout nutrition (a protein shake before bed, eating within an hour of exercise) are also crucial. The text emphasizes avoiding junk food and alcohol. A recommended workout structure is 3 sets of 6-8 repetitions per exercise, targeting 3 exercises per body part, with at least 48 hours of recovery between working the same muscle groups.

The cause of Tourette Syndrome remains unknown, though research suggests a possible genetic component and some theories propose a link to early antibiotic use.","Tourette syndrome is a neurobiological disorder that causes involuntary vocal tremors and tics. It is migratory, meaning the tics can change over time. Tourette's is a lifelong condition, and while there is no cure, medications can help lessen the impact of the tics. The severity of Tourette's varies, and finding the right combination of medications may take time and patience. Tourette's is often accompanied by other conditions such as OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) and ADHD.There has been a genetic breakthrough related to Tourette's at Harvard, offering hope for future treatments. It's essential to consult a Neurologist, particularly a Pediatric Neurologist for individuals under 16, for an accurate diagnosis. Well-meaning individuals may not be qualified to diagnose this disorder.The exact cause of Tourette's is unknown, but some theories suggest a possible link to early antibiotic use. Recent genomic mapping has provided insights, raising the possibility of future cures."

1105741,HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR THE HIV TO APPEAR POSITIVE AFTER SOMEONE GETS INFECTED WITH IT?,"For information purposes, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection doesn't automatically progress to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in all individuals; some people live with HIV for many years without developing AIDS. However, individuals with HIV can still transmit the virus to others, who may then develop AIDS. Current HIV testing methods have awindow period' of approximately 2-3 months after initial infection, during which the virus may not be detectable. A negative test result after 6 months, with no further risk exposure, is generally considered a reliable negative result. It's important to note that unverified claims exist suggesting HIV tests *cause* AIDS, but these lack substantial evidence. **Regarding how long it takes for HIV to appear positive after infection, standard tests may not detect it for up to 3 months, and confirmation typically requires testing after 6 months to rule out recent infection.** It is crucial to consult a doctor for accurate testing, diagnosis, and management of HIV.","For information purposes, some individuals may remain HIV-positive without developing full-blown AIDS. The potential for transmission during the 2-3 month window when the virus may not be detectable and suggests that after 6 months of negative testing, one is considered officially negative."
1105741,HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR THE HIV TO APPEAR POSITIVE AFTER SOMEONE GETS INFECTED WITH IT?,"Some of the causes related to progression from HIV to AIDS, or remaining solely with HIV, are dependent on individual health and immune response. While not everyone infected with HIV develops AIDS, they can still transmit the virus to others who *may* then develop the disease. A key factor influencing detection is the window period typically 2-3 months after initial infection where standard tests may not yet identify HIV. Officially being considered negative generally requires six months of negative testing *and* avoidance of risky behaviors during that time. There is unsubstantiated speculation that the HIV testing process itself may contribute to the development of AIDS, though this lacks substantial evidence. **Regarding how long it takes for HIV to appear positive after infection:** The timeframe varies, but standard tests may not detect HIV for 2-3 months post-infection. Therefore, a negative result within this window period isn't conclusive.",user said HIV testing may cause the development of AIDS.
1105741,HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR THE HIV TO APPEAR POSITIVE AFTER SOMEONE GETS INFECTED WITH IT?,"It is suggested that understanding your HIV status requires medical evaluation and consistent monitoring. While some individuals may live with HIV for many years without developing AIDS, they remain capable of transmitting the virus. It's important to be aware of the window period typically 2-3 months after potential exposure where standard tests may not detect HIV, and that repeated negative tests over six months (with continued safe practices) are generally considered reliable. Regarding how long it takes for HIV to appear positive after infection, current testing methods have a detection window, and results should be interpreted by a healthcare professional. There are unverified claims about testing *causing* HIV progression, but these lack substantial evidence. Ultimately, the strongest recommendation is to **consult a doctor** for accurate testing, diagnosis, and guidance. If you test positive, seek medical care for a healthy life; if negative, use this as motivation for ongoing prevention.",It is suggested to see a doctor for potential HIV.

686712,What is the difference between ejaculation and an orgasm?,"For information purposes, ejaculation is the process by which a male expels reproductive fluid (sperm), containing either X or Y chromosomes essential for potential fertilization. Sperm is released from the penis. Conversely, an orgasm in females is a muscular reaction, typically triggered by clitoral stimulation, resulting in a feeling of intense pleasure or euphoria. Therefore, the key difference is that ejaculation is a *physiological process* in males involving the release of sperm, while an orgasm is a *physiological and psychological experience* of intense pleasure, primarily experienced by females through clitoral stimulation though males can also experience orgasm.","Ejaculation in men refers to the expulsion of reproductive fluid (sperm) from the penis, containing either X or Y chromosomes crucial for conception. On the other hand, orgasm in women involves a muscular reaction to various stimuli, often direct stimulation of the clitoris, leading to a profound sense of euphoria when adequately aroused. These physiological responses are integral to the reproductive processes and sexual experiences of men and women, respectively."

3334201,how long is a antibiotics life span?,"For information purposes, this advice from experienced nurses suggests that expired antibiotics are unlikely to be effective due to a loss of potency over time. Taking old medication may not treat a current infection, as the specific antibiotic may no longer be appropriate for the illness. It is recommended to consult a doctor for a diagnosis and current prescription. Doctors' offices often provide free antibiotic samples, and if emergency room treatment is needed, options like amoxicillin are generally inexpensive. Regarding the lifespan of antibiotics, the core message is that their effectiveness diminishes with age, making current medical consultation crucial.","Expired antibiotics likely have reduced potency and may not be effective in treating infections. It's advisable to avoid taking expired antibiotics, as they might not provide the intended therapeutic benefits. While some people may access free antibiotics from doctor's offices, it's essential to consider the potential limitations of using medications past their expiration dates.

1507604,Do I have an STD?,"For information purposes, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can only be definitively diagnosed through medical testing. Symptoms like itching, fever, and lower abdominal discomfort *may* indicate an STD, such as herpes, or a bacterial infection requiring antibiotic treatment. However, these symptoms are not exclusive to STDs and can vary significantly between individuals. Specifically, it takes 3-6 months after potential exposure to detect HIV/AIDS. Herpes is a notable STD with no known cure, and can be spread even without visible symptoms. If there is any concern following potential exposure (unprotected sex), consulting a doctor for testing including a Pap smear for females is strongly advised. It is crucial to abstain from sexual activity until a diagnosis is confirmed. While anxiety is understandable, it's important to seek professional medical advice rather than self-diagnosing.","If you had unprotected sex with someone who has an STD, it takes three months after the exposure to detect HIV/AIDS. For females experiencing itching and fever, it could be a bacterial infection, which can be temporarily relieved but may return without antibiotic and cream treatments. Bacterial infections may also cause discomfort in the lower abdomen. The challenge with herpes is that there is no cure, and it can be spread even without visible signs or symptoms. While waiting for testing, the primary concern is HIV, which takes 3-6 months to detect. Initial symptoms of herpes include oral and/or genital lesions, fever, and pain in the groin area. It's important to note that the absence of lesions does not guarantee the absence of an STD, as individual reactions to infections can vary."
1507604,Do I have an STD?,"Some of the causes of potential STD exposure, and therefore the reasons to seek testing, stem from unprotected sexual contact with an infected individual. Specifically, the content highlights potential causes for symptoms like itching, fever, and lower abdominal discomfort suggesting possibilities like bacterial infections *or* sexually transmitted diseases such as herpes. Herpes is repeatedly identified as a potential cause, with the significant caveat that there is no cure. While HIV/AIDS is mentioned as a concern, detection typically requires a 3-6 month window after potential exposure. Ultimately, the lack of visible symptoms doesn't negate the possibility of an STD, as individual reactions vary, and the primary cause for concern and subsequent action is potential exposure through sexual activity.","The symptoms described, including itching and high fever, may be attributed to nervousness or stress, but it is crucial to seek the care of a competent health professional promptly. While herpes is suggested due to its typical features of itching and flu-like symptoms, various other infections could be responsible. Immediate consultation with a healthcare professional is recommended to accurately diagnose the condition and initiate appropriate care."

2231624,Does Mono give you Chronic Fatigue?,"For information purposes, the relationship between infectious mononucleosis (mono, or Epstein Barr virus) and Chronic Fatigue Immune Disorder (CFID) is complex. While mono *can* contribute to CFID, it doesn't always. The presence of Epstein Barr virus *antibodies* produced by the body to fight the virus, even long after the initial infection is cleared can be associated with CFID. However, experiencing fatigue *after* mono doesn't automatically mean CFID has developed. Recovery time from mono varies; some individuals fully recover within a year, while others may experience prolonged fatigue, particularly if they did not adequately rest during the initial illness. It's important to note that there is currently no cure for CFID. Mono can also recur. If experiencing persistent fatigue following a mono infection, seeking a second medical opinion is advised, as symptoms could potentially be related to other conditions.","For information purposes, Epstein Barr is synonymous with mono, or infectious mononucleosis. Antibodies, produced by the body to combat infections, typically become dormant after the virus is no longer present."
2231624,Does Mono give you Chronic Fatigue?,"Some of the causes of Chronic Fatigue Immune Disorder (CFID) can be linked to a past Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection commonly known as Mono. While not always the case, the presence of a high level of EBV antibodies *after* the active virus has cleared can contribute to the development of CFID. However, proper rest and self-care *during* the initial Mono infection can prevent this outcome. Recurring Mono infections may also be a factor. It's important to note that fatigue following Mono typically resolves within a year with adequate recovery, and other conditions may present with similar symptoms; therefore, a second medical opinion is advisable. Ultimately, while EBV can be a causative factor, CFID currently has no known cure.","Some of the causes of Chronic Fatigue Immune Disorder include the presence of a high number of Epstein-Barr virus antibodies in the bloodstream. These antibodies, which remain active, can contribute to Chronic Fatigue."
2231624,Does Mono give you Chronic Fatigue?,"It is suggested that while Mono (infectious mononucleosis, or Epstein Barr virus) *can* be linked to Chronic Fatigue Immune Disorder, it's not a guaranteed outcome. If persistent fatigue follows a Mono infection, particularly if antibody tests show high levels even when the virus is no longer active in the blood, further investigation into Chronic Fatigue is warranted. However, proper rest and self-care *during* the initial Mono infection are strongly recommended to minimize the risk of long-term fatigue. If fatigue persists beyond a year, or if a diagnosis feels inaccurate, seeking a second medical opinion is advisable, as other conditions may be at play. It's also important to note that currently, there are no cures for Chronic Fatigue, and Mono can potentially reoccur.","It is suggested to consider seeking a second medical opinion, as chronic fatigue following a historical diagnosis of mononucleosis is atypical. The symptoms described may instead indicate Myalgia. Consulting with a healthcare professional can provide clarity and guide appropriate treatment"
2231624,Does Mono give you Chronic Fatigue?,"In my experience, dealing with lingering fatigue after mono was incredibly frustrating. I felt constantly exhausted for a long time, and my doctor initially dismissed it, even suggesting a mental health issue. I *knew* something was physically wrong, especially since I'd had mono twice before. It turned out I had a high level of Epstein Barr virus antibodies even though the virus itself wasn't active and that's what my doctor believes led to my Chronic Fatigue Immune Disorder. While I understand mono *can* lead to long-term fatigue, I also believe proper rest during the initial illness is key; if you take care of yourself, a full recovery within a year is possible. Unfortunately, if chronic fatigue does develop, there aren't any cures, and getting a second opinion is definitely something I'd recommend. It's also worth noting that mono can sometimes come back, or the fatigue could be something else entirely!","In users experience, one user shares the expereince of Chronic Fatigue caused by Epstein Barr virus, although it doesn't always lead to this condition. The user experienced persistent fatigue and underwent numerous tests, with a doctor initially attributing it to mental illness. Eventually, testing for Epstein Barr virus antibodies revealed an absence of the virus but a presence of numerous antibodies, potentially causing the chronic fatigue. The fatigue associated with this condition can persist for an extended period, contrasting with the speaker's recovery from mono, where normalcy returned within a year."
2233578,Why do I cough more at night?,"Some of the causes for increased coughing, particularly at night, relate to atmospheric and physiological changes. Dropping barometric pressure overnight alters humidity levels indoors, potentially leading to nasal congestion and increased post-nasal drip, which then triggers coughing. Lying down also exacerbates coughing compared to sitting upright. Additionally, underlying conditions like asthma, potentially triggered by environmental factors, or even the flu can be responsible. Finally, infection and spread of the flu can cause coughing as well.","Some of the causes of night time coughing may include changes in barometric pressure leading to altered humidity in the home, resulting in nasal congestion and increased drainage that may contribute to coughing. Additionally, asthma triggered by substances in the room or postnasal drip could be underlying factors."
2233578,Why do I cough more at night?,"It is suggested that your nighttime cough may be due to several factors. Atmospheric changes linked to dropping barometric pressure can increase nasal congestion and drainage, potentially triggering more coughing when lying down. To alleviate this, propping yourself up with pillows before bed is recommended, as is taking a cough medicine right before sleep. Additionally, consider a nighttime antihistamine or decongestant to address potential post-nasal drip. For air travel, an over-the-counter inhaler like Primatene Mist *may* help prevent lung constriction. However, it is strongly advised to consult a doctor to rule out underlying conditions like asthma, which could be triggered by environmental factors. While some find temporary relief with cough drops, prolonged use is discouraged due to potential dental issues. Finally, if you suspect you have the flu, it is recommended to isolate yourself to prevent spreading infection to others.","It is suggested to avoid coughing at night an on a plane, consider using an over-the-counter inhaler like Primatene Mist to prevent lung constriction during the flight. Consult with a doctor for testing and potential treatment if necessary. When lying down, use extra pillows to elevate the upper body, reducing night time coughing. Taking a cough medicine before bedtime, particularly one that dries up the nose, and using an antihistamine at night may also provide relief."
2233578,Why do I cough more at night?,"In my experience, nighttime coughing is really tough. I've found that changes in air pressure and humidity overnight things dropping as the barometric pressure falls seem to make congestion worse, leading to more drainage and, ultimately, more coughing. For years, I've actually slept with a cough drop in my mouth just to stop the coughing, even though I know it's probably not great for my teeth! It's a trade-off I've been willing to make. When traveling, especially on planes, I've had some relief using an over-the-counter inhaler like Primatene Mist. And I definitely notice I cough more when lying down, so propping myself up with pillows helps a little. I also rely on a good cough medicine before bed. It sounds like it could be post-nasal drip, and I've found nighttime antihistamines can help dry things up just be sure to pick the right kind so you *can* sleep! I'm no doctor, but it might be worth asking yours about asthma, as something in your environment could be triggering it. And if you think you have the flu, please stay home to avoid spreading it to others.","In users expereince, one user shared their experience of sleeping with a cough drop in their mouth to avoid coughing during night. They shared that this might eventually lead to rotting of their teeth."

Gynaecologists diagnose and treat conditions related to the vagina, uterus, ovaries, and related organs. Common surgical procedures performed by gynaecologists include termination of pregnancy, dilation and curettage (D&C), hysterectomy (uterus removal), oophorectomy (ovary removal), tubal ligation, and LLETZ procedure for pre-cancerous cervical cells. Diagnostic procedures include exploratory laparoscopy/laparotomy, colposuspension for incontinence, and various examinations utilizing tools like the speculum and bimanual exams. Investigations used to aid diagnosis encompass abdominal and vaginal ultrasounds, blood tests to measure hormone levels, hysteroscopy, and laparoscopy with MRI, CT scans, and pelvic X-rays used less frequently. Gynaecologists address a range of diseases and conditions, including cervical cancer (screened for via Pap smears), urinary incontinence, amenorrhoea (absent periods), dysmenorrhoea (painful periods), infertility, menorrhagia (heavy periods), and prolapse. Typically, patients are referred to a gynaecologist by a general practitioner when specialized knowledge or equipment is required; however, in the United States, gynaecologists can also function as primary care physicians. The core of diagnosis relies on a patient's medical history and physical examination.","For information purposes, gynaecologists perform various operations, including termination of pregnancy, dilation and curettage, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, tubal ligation, exploratory laparoscopy or laparotomy, colposuspension, and Large Loop Excision of the Transition Zone (LLETZ) for removing pre-cancerous cells on the cervix. Gynaecology is typically a consultant specialty, and women usually consult a general practitioner first, who may then refer them to a gynaecologist if needed. Gynaecological examinations involve clinical history, intimate examinations, and may include the use of a speculum and other tools. Investigations may include abdominal and vaginal ultrasounds, blood tests for hormone levels, hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, and imaging studies like MRI or CT scans.

Several strategies are presented, though their efficacy is not universally established and professional consultation is advised. Regarding blood sugar control, suggestions include incorporating cinnamon into the diet, but caution is advised against exercising when blood sugar is already high due to the risk of dangerous ketone production without sufficient insulin. Dietary modifications are frequently mentioned: reducing meat intake (as 45% of protein converts to glucose), eating smaller, timed meals (suggested schedule: 8:30 am breakfast, 12:30 pm lunch, 5:30 pm dinner), and avoiding whole wheat products, which one individual found elevated blood sugar for extended periods. Specific natural remedies mentioned are Gymnema sylvestre (taken with meals, dosage varies), ripe papaya (consumed on an empty stomach), and watermelon seed kernels (half a teaspoon daily). Other suggestions include consuming radishes and adding vinegar to the diet. The importance of individual food testing to determine personal blood sugar responses is emphasized.The content also touches on the impact of acidity on digestion and blood sugar, suggesting avoiding acidic foods and aggressive exercise to prevent stomach tissue damage.

1093400,Are Chiropractors real doctors?,"For information purposes, the distinction between areal doctor' often hinges on the ability to prescribe medication. While chiropractors hold a doctoral degree (DC Doctor of Chiropractic), they are not Medical Doctors (MD) or Doctors of Osteopathy (DO) and therefore cannot prescribe drugs. This difference stems from differing philosophical approaches to healthcare: medical doctors typically employ anoutside-in' method focusing on symptom reduction through interventions like medication or surgery, while chiropractors utilize aninside-out' approach aiming to restore the body's natural healing capabilities by addressing spinal misalignments and improving communication between the brain and body. Chiropractors undergo extensive training, completing a bachelor's degree followed by a rigorous five-year program. Comparative analysis of coursework hours between Johns Hopkins Medical School and Palmer College of Chiropractic demonstrates comparable, and in some areas, exceeding, hours dedicated to subjects like anatomy, physiology, pathology, and diagnosis with chiropractic programs totaling 4,485 hours versus medical school's 3,397 hours (including other required subjects), as documented by the National Health Federation.","It depends on how one considers a real doctor. Chiropractors, designated as DCs, are not medical doctors (M.D. or D.O.) and cannot prescribe medication. They employ an ""Inside-Out"" approach, focusing on restoring normal body function for self-healing, contrasting with the ""Outside-In"" approach of medical doctors. While chiropractic is not a cure-all, misalignments in the spine affecting brain-body communication can be addressed by chiropractors. Most chiropractors undergo a rigorous 5-year program after completing their bachelor's degree."
1169539,Why is urine bright yellow after taking B complex vitamins?,"For information purposes, the body processes vitamins similarly to a dam it absorbs what it needs and excretes the excess. This explains why vitamin supplementation, particularly in the United States, often results in unused vitamins being eliminated in urine. This is evidenced by the observation that American urine is often referred to as being themost expensive' due to the high volume of excreted vitamins. Adequate water intake (approximately 70% of the body is water) is crucial to help the body process and utilize vitamins effectively. Specifically, the bright yellow color observed in urine after taking B-complex vitamins is due to the presence of riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, being excreted.","For information purposes, the human body, comprising 70% water, contains Riboflavin (B2) which gives urine it's yellow color.  The body eliminates excess vitamins, including B2, through urine."
1169539,Why is urine bright yellow after taking B complex vitamins?,"Some of the causes of bright yellow urine, particularly after taking B complex vitamins, stem from exceeding the body's capacity to utilize water-soluble vitamins. The body absorbs only what it needs for function; excess vitamins, like those in B complex (specifically Riboflavin/Vitamin B2), are then excreted through urine. This phenomenon is common in populations, like those in America, who frequently consume vitamin supplements, leading to a higher concentration of vitamins being filtered out and resulting in vividly colored urine. Adequate water intake is crucial to help the body process and eliminate these excess vitamins efficiently, given that the body is composed of approximately 70% water.",Riboflavin a B2 vitamin turns urine yellow.
1169539,Why is urine bright yellow after taking B complex vitamins?,"It is suggested that you prioritize hydration when taking vitamin supplements, particularly B-complex vitamins. The body efficiently utilizes vitamins when adequately supplied, but excess vitamins are simply excreted through urine a phenomenon contributing to the observation of costly urine in the United States due to high supplement consumption. To answer your question regarding bright yellow urine after taking B-complex vitamins, this color change is normal and is specifically due to the presence of riboflavin (vitamin B2) being expelled from the body. Ensuring you drink plenty of water remembering our bodies are approximately 70% water, not caffeinated beverages will support optimal vitamin absorption and utilization.",It is suggested to drink a lot of water with vitamins
552474,what's bird flu?,"For information purposes, avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is a type of influenza virus primarily hosted by birds but capable of infecting mammals. First identified in the early 1900s, it is now globally present. Several subtypes have been confirmed to infect humans, including H1N1 (responsible for the Spanish Flu), H2N2 (Asian Flu), H3N2 (Hong Kong Flu), and notably H5N1 considered a potential source for a future pandemic, having caused 68 deaths from 133 infections in Asia since 2003. The current outbreak, largely affecting poultry in Asia (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam), is caused by the H5N1 strain. Transmission to humans occurs through close contact with infected birds or their feces; human-to-human transmission is not currently known. Symptoms in humans include fever, coughing, and can progress to pneumonia. Control measures focus on culling infected bird populations, and the World Health Organization is monitoring the virus for potential recombination with human influenza viruses, which could lead to a serious epidemic. Consuming eggs or meat from infected birds is not currently considered a transmission route.","For information purposes, avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, is caused by influenza viruses hosted by birds but capable of infecting various mammal species. Originating in Serbia Montenegro in the early 1900s, it has become a global concern. The H5N1-type, identified in 1997, is a potential source of a future influenza pandemic and has caused numerous human infections in Asia, resulting in significant fatalities. Avian influenza subtypes in humans include H1N1 (Spanish flu), H2N2 (Asian Flu), H3N2 (Hong Kong Flu), H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, H7N2, and H7N3. The virus, particularly strain H5N1, has led to the death of hundreds of thousands of birds in Asia, impacting poultry in various countries. While the disease is highly contagious among birds, transmission to humans occurs through close contact or exposure to infected bird feces, with no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Eradication involves culling infected flocks, and millions of poultry have been culled to contain the virus. There is concern that the virus could potentially combine with a human influenza virus, leading to a serious epidemic. Human symptoms include fever, coughing, and, in severe cases, pneumonia."
1648214,What is the difference between the mental illnesses psychoaffective disorder and schizoaffective disorder?,"For information purposes, the termpsychoaffective disorder' is not a recognized medical diagnosis. It is likely the psychiatrist intended to convey a diagnosis of **schizoaffective disorder**. Obtaining a precise, standardized diagnosis is beneficial for clear communication between mental health professionals, even if it doesn't immediately alter treatment. Treatment for schizoaffective disorder, like many mental illnesses, focuses on managing **symptoms** with medication; currently, there is no cure. Medication is typically required for several years to maintain stability. While medication discontinuation is *possible* after a prolonged period of wellness, there remains a risk of symptom **relapse**.This addresses the question of difference by clarifying thatpsychoaffective disorder' isn't a distinct illness, but likely refers to the formally defined schizoaffective disorder a condition characterized by symptoms of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder.","For information purposes, the term ""Psychoaffective disorder"" is not a precise diagnosis, and it is recommended to seek a more specific one for clarity in communication among mental health professionals. While treatment focuses on symptom management, there is no cure for the illness. If the diagnosis is accurate, medications need to be continued for an extended period, potentially several years. Discontinuation may be considered if the patient remains stable, but there's a risk of relapse."
744954,Where is the gum?,"For information purposes, a measurement of 4 mm refers to the depth of gum pockets the space between the gums and the bone supporting the teeth. Measurements exceeding 4 mm indicate potential bone loss, commonly caused by periodontal disease, a gum infection. This disease can be prevented through consistent oral hygiene practices, specifically brushing at least twice daily for two minutes *and* regular flossing. Flossing is particularly important as it targets the areas between teeth where food and bacteria accumulate, requiring a technique of moving the floss along the sides of each tooth to effectively remove plaque. Regarding the location of the gum, it forms the soft tissue surrounding the teeth and extends to the alveolar bone which provides support for the teeth. Gum pocket depth is measured from the top of the gum down to this bone.","For information purposes, a measurement of 4 mm likely pertains to the depth of gum pockets, which is the space between the top of your gums and the alveolar bone holding your teeth. Dentists use a probe to measure this depth. If the pockets exceed 4 mm, it indicates potential bone loss, often associated with periodontal disease'an infection in the gums."
744954,Where is the gum?,"It is suggested that the 4mm measurement your dentist noted likely indicates the depth of your gum pockets, and a reading above 4mm suggests potential bone loss due to periodontal disease. To proactively prevent this, we recommend a consistent oral hygiene routine, with a *strong emphasis* on flossing. While brushing twice daily for two minutes is important, flossing is crucial for removing bacteria and plaque from the often-missed areas between teeth. When flossing, focus on thoroughly cleaning the sides of each tooth with an up-and-down motion, repeating two to three times on both sides of the contact point, rather than simply forcing the floss between the teeth. This diligent approach will help maintain gum health and prevent further issues.","The most effective way to prevent periodontal problems is through regular brushing and, crucially, flossing (at least twice a day for two minutes each). Emphasizing the importance of flossing is essential, as it targets the areas between teeth where food and bacteria often accumulate. Flossing aims to thoroughly clean the surfaces where two teeth meet, requiring a technique that follows the sides of the teeth for optimal plaque removal. Going up and down two to three times along both sides of the tooth at the contact point ensures a comprehensive cleaning process. Prioritizing these oral hygiene practices is key to maintaining periodontal health."

735322,"If you take depression pills for year and will stop taking them, would your body long for them?","In my experience, stopping depression medication isn't a one-size-fits-all situation. It really depends on the person, the medication, and how long you've been on it. I've known people who stopped strong drugs easily, while for me, after 30 years, stopping is now a life-threatening prospect. I personally went through a period of withdrawal when *I* stopped taking medication it felt like losing all the positive feelings I had built up, a real emotional drain. However, another person I know stopped Wellbutrin after three years with absolutely no negative effects, and admitted they hadn't even enjoyed taking them in the first place. What I've learned is that everyone's experience is different. It's not necessarily a physical longing, but withdrawal *is* likely. The best approach, and what I'd strongly advise, is to work with your doctor to slowly lower the dosage before stopping completely. That's what could have made all the difference for me.","Individual experiences with withdrawal from medication can vary significantly. One person emphasizes that withdrawal is a definite challenge after taking medication for about 30 years, describing it as potentially life-threatening. Another person shares a personal experience of a noticeable withdrawal, likening it to losing positive feelings about oneself and life, with effects not occurring immediately due to the gradual elimination of the medicine from the system. On the other hand, a different individual reports having no ill effects after stopping medication for three years and expressing a lack of enjoyment in taking them. This highlights the diverse and individual nature of withdrawal experiences."

1174933,can kissing cause HIV  infection ?,"For information purposes, this content addresses common misconceptions surrounding HIV/AIDS transmission, specifically in relation to kissing. The primary message is that HIV is **not** transmitted through saliva, even duringwet' kissing. Transmission occurs through the exchange of specific bodily fluids: blood and semen. HIV weakens the body's immune system by attacking and destroying CD4+ T cells, crucial components of immune function. A declining CD4+ T cell count (below 200/mm3) leads to increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and the development of AIDS, the advanced stage of HIV infection.Data from 2001 indicates the following transmission routes in the US: among adult males with AIDS, 57.5% contracted it through sex with other men, 24% through injecting drugs, and 9.5% through heterosexual contact. For adult females with AIDS, 38% contracted it through injecting drugs and 59% through heterosexual contact. While the risk of transmission through kissing is extremely low potentially plausible only with open sores in the mouth the content emphasizes the importance of accurate information to combat the spread of the virus. It also notes the potential for transmission of other infections like Mono and Herpes through kissing.","HIV is not transmitted through saliva. Transmission occurs through blood and sexual intercourse. The main causes of HIV/AIDS include sex with other men (57.5% for adult males), injecting drugs (24% for adult males, 38% for adult females), and heterosexual contact (9.5% for adult males, 59% for adult females). HIV disease weakens the immune system by destroying CD4+ T cells, making individuals susceptible to infections and cancers. AIDS, the end stage of HIV, is characterized by severe health complications such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological issues, and specific cancers like Kaposi's sarcoma. HIV likely induces AIDS by directly harming CD4+ T cells, disrupting immune response signaling, and damaging lymph nodes and immune organs."
1174933,can kissing cause HIV  infection ?,"Some of the causes of HIV/AIDS center around the transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which progressively damages the body's immune system by killing or impairing CD4+ T cells critical components of immune response. This weakening of the immune system ultimately leads to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and susceptibility to opportunistic infections and cancers. Statistically, in the US in 2001, the primary causes of HIV/AIDS differed by gender: among adult males, 57.5% contracted the virus through male-to-male sexual contact, 24% through injecting drugs, and 9.5% through heterosexual contact. For adult females, 38% contracted it through injecting drugs, and 59% through heterosexual contact. While misconceptions exist, HIV is *not* transmitted through saliva, even duringwet' kissing, unless both individuals have open sores in the mouth. The virus is primarily spread through blood and sexual intercourse. HIV directly attacks and destroys CD4+ T cells, disrupting the immune system's signaling and function, and damaging lymph nodes, ultimately leading to severe immunosuppression.","HIV/AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which weakens the immune system by damaging its cells.

3282304,how fast do eyelashes grow? as fast as the hair on your head or faster?,"For information purposes, eyelashes, like all human hair, grow at roughly the same rate. However, they have a pre-determined maximum length and naturally fall out once reached, being replaced by new growth. This cycle of growth and shedding continues throughout life. While an individual may perceive faster growth as observed after an injury like a burn eyelashes typically take approximately two to three months to fully grow. Notably, this faster growth and the potential for influencing length through trimming is most applicable to infants, as advised by pediatricians. To answer the question of growth speed relative to head hair, eyelashes grow *at* the same rate, but *appear* faster growing due to their shorter lifespan and cyclical shedding.","For information purposes, all hair on the human body generally grows at about the same speed. However, certain types of hair, such as eyelashes, are pre-programmed to grow to specific lengths. For example, eyelash hair takes about two to three months to grow to a certain length before falling out, and a new one begins to grow in its place. This cycle repeats throughout a person's life. While eyelashes may appear to grow faster, they don't become exceptionally long because they naturally fall out and are replaced in a continuous cycle. This information is generally applicable to individuals beyond the baby stage."

I remember my friend accidentally burning his eyelashes, and they were fully grown back within just five days his face looked completely normal again so soon! While I understand all hair grows at roughly the same rate, it *feels* faster with eyelashes. They do fall out regularly as part of a cycle, making way for new growth, but they don't get super long because of this. I also recall my mom being told by the pediatrician that trimming a baby's eyelashes can actually encourage them to grow longer, something she did with my little sister when she was just a few weeks old. It seems like this faster growth, or at least the perception of it, is most noticeable in babies.","In one case, a friend experienced rapid eyelash growth after accidentally burning his eyelashes. By the fifth day, his eyelashes had returned to normal length. In another instance, a pediatrician advised trimming a baby sister's eyelashes when she was a few weeks old, suggesting that such practices might influence the perceived length of eyelashes. However, it's important to note that natural growth cycles and genetics play significant roles in determining the length of eyelashes."

Approximately 25% of individuals never experience outbreaks, and many have mild or asymptomatic infections where they can still be contagious. Regarding the question of whether an outbreak would have occurredby now,' the text suggests it *may* be too early to definitively rule out infection based on the absence of lesions. Testing is crucial. If lesions are present, a fluid sample can be tested directly for the herpes virus. If no lesions appear, a blood test for herpes antibodies (both HSV-1 and HSV-2, specifically IgM antibodies) is recommended, but should be delayed 8-12 weeks after potential exposure to allow sufficient antibody development for accurate results. The HerpeSelect antibody test is identified as a standard option.The text also briefly touches on concerns about privacy, suggesting seeking care away from one's local area if confidentiality is a worry.","For information purposes, the onset of physical lesions in a herpes infection can take up to two to three weeks after being infected. However, individuals may respond differently to the initial infection, with some people never experiencing outbreaks (approximately 25%). Moreover, many individuals may only have mild symptoms or be asymptomatic carriers, meaning they are contagious without visible symptoms (asymptomatic viral shedding). It is best to get tested when you notice any lesions. A direct sample of the fluid from the lesions can be taken and tested for the herpes virus. Even in the absence of visible outbreaks, it's recommended to wait about 8 to 12 weeks from the time of exposure to undergo a blood test for herpes antibodies.

1667363,why do we fart?,"For information purposes, a fart also known as flatulence or a Frequency Actuated Rectal Tremor is the expulsion of intestinal gas from the rectum. This gas originates from two primary sources: the breakdown of food during digestion and fermentation, and swallowed air. Digestion releases gases as enzymes, stomach acids, and intestinal bacteria work to extract energy from food. Additionally, air swallowed through activities like eating, drinking, and even stress, which isn't released as a burp, travels to the intestines and contributes to gas production. Gas can also seep into the intestines from the blood and be produced by chemical reactions within the gut, as well as by the bacteria residing there. Ultimately, this buildup of gas in the lower digestive tract is relieved through flatulence. The process is a natural function and helps to alleviate discomfort caused by internal gas pressure. Feces also contribute to gas production as it decays.","Farting, scientifically known as flatulence, is the release of intestinal gas from the rectum. The gas results from various sources, including the breakdown of food by digestive processes and the swallowing of air.

The core argument centers on the claim that cannabis has *never* directly caused a fatality, contrasting this with the known death tolls associated with legal substances like tobacco and alcohol. Furthermore, the text highlights numerous potential medical applications of cannabis, including treatment for eating disorders, cancer, multiple sclerosis, migraines, and certain mental health conditions. The author dismisses common misconceptions about cannabis use, asserting it doesn't induce violence or impair intelligence, and points to successful individuals in professional fields who consume cannabis. They advocate for legalization as a potential source of tax revenue for the government and suggest responsible regulation, including restrictions on driving or operating machinery while under the influence, similar to alcohol laws. While strongly supporting cannabis legalization, the author explicitly states opposition to legalizing drugs like cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine without proven medical benefits and physician supervision. Finally, the author emphasizes personal accountability even while under the influence of cannabis.","For information purposes, the argument against cannabis legalization stems from the concern that individuals who start with cannabis may progress to using cocaine. Despite the fact that no one has ever died from using cannabis and it has numerous medicinal benefits, this perspective emphasizes the importance of holding individuals accountable for their actions, even under the influence of cannabis. The argument acknowledges that while cannabis may not directly cause dangerous behaviors like reckless driving or theft, individuals should still be responsible for their actions and cannot blame cannabis for their choices."
497224,Should Cannabis be legalized? Give reasons why yes or not.?,"In my experience, the idea that cannabis always leads to harder drugs is simply wrong. My own path was the opposite I started with cocaine, which then led *to* marijuana, and ultimately, I chose to leave cocaine behind. That's why I strongly believe cannabis should be legalized. It feels illogical that something that has *never* directly caused a death is illegal, while substances like alcohol and tobacco, which kill thousands yearly, are readily available. I've personally found cannabis to be a calming influence, unlike alcohol which I've experienced can lead to conflict. The negative stereotypes that it turns people intolosers' are just untrue. I know successful professionals, even in fields like medicine and law, who use it responsibly. Beyond personal experience, I'm aware of its many medical applications for conditions like eating disorders, cancer, MS, and migraines. I also think legalization makes practical sense; the government could generate significant tax revenue, potentially helping with the national debt. While I wouldn't personally use it due to asthma, I support responsible adult use, with strict rules against driving or operating machinery while under the influence. I don't extend that support to drugs like cocaine or heroin unless proven medically beneficial and physician-supervised. Ultimately, I believe the biggest hurdle to legalization isn't the drug itself, but figuring out how the government can profit from it and control the market to prevent cheaper, untaxed sources. And while using cannabis shouldn't excuse irresponsible behavior, people should still be held accountable for their actions.","Opinions on the legalization of marijuana vary. One individual shares a personal experience, expressing support for legalization due to marijuana's non-lethal nature, medical benefits, and the misconception of its negative effects. They highlight the contradiction of legalizing substances like tobacco and alcohol, which cause thousands of deaths, while marijuana, with its purported medical uses, remains illegal. Another perspective emphasizes the lack of sufficient reasons to keep marijuana illegal, emphasizing its medicinal benefits. A third opinion acknowledges the potential dangers of impaired driving but supports legalization with restrictions for adult use, drawing a distinction between marijuana and more harmful drugs like cocaine, heroin, crystal methamphetamine, or ecstasy. This person suggests considering the medical benefits of these substances under proper supervision if proven effective. Overall, the opinions range from supporting legalization for various reasons to advocating restrictions for responsible adult use."

I drink a *lot* of fluids, especially non-concentrated orange juice and water, to help flush everything out. I've found this combination really speeds up my recovery. Over the years, I've also relied on a few key supplements. A daily multivitamin with B-12 is a must for keeping my immune system strong, and I swear by Zicam when I feel sick. I've had great success with Airborne too, especially when taken at the very first sign of symptoms it's really shortened cold durations for me and my family.

Another person relies on Zicam to shorten the duration of the cold and credits it with preventing other colds so far. The use of Vitamin C (1000 mg) and EmergenC is also mentioned. Pampering oneself with enjoyable activities, treating the time off work as a mini-vacation, and focusing on stress reduction are proposed as ways to speed up recovery. Lastly, allowing the body to use its natural healing processes without medication is suggested, along with staying warm, avoiding ill contacts, and taking decongestants and soothers."

1808395,What are the best multivitamins in terms of absorption and providing all essential vitamins?,"In my experience, getting enough vitamins can be tricky, even when trying to eat healthily life gets busy and balanced diets aren't always possible. I've personally found that tablets often don't sit well with me, making me feel nauseous, so I switched to liquid vitamins which seem to absorb much faster and easier. A story my naturopath shared really stuck with me; a client found *thousands* of undissolved vitamin tablets at the bottom of their septic tank! It was a real eye-opener and convinced me tablets might just be a waste of money. While a good diet is ideal, I currently take Centrum Performance and feel it works well for me. I've also heard good things about the Mega Man/Woman series from GNC, and believe they are well-absorbed too. Ultimately, it seems absorption is key, and it might be worth looking into dissolution tests if you're really concerned about getting the most out of your vitamins.","In users expereince, one individual cannot tolerate tablets due to the chemicals causing nausea. Their Naturopath shared a story about a client whose holding tank for sewage had thousands of undissolved multi-vitamins at the bottom. This revelation led the individual to stop taking tablets.

3315556,What is multiple sclerosis?,"For information purposes, multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease impacting the central nervous system specifically the brain and spinal cord. It most frequently affects women and typically manifests between the ages of 20 and 40, though onset can occur at any age. MS is characterized by damage to the myelin sheath, the protective covering of nerve cells, caused by inflammation resulting from the body's immune system attacking the nervous system. This damage leads to slowed or blocked nerve impulses. The disease is progressive, with symptoms appearing in episodes (flare-ups) that can last days, weeks, or months, alternating with periods of remission, though some individuals experience continuous progression.While the exact cause remains unknown, current theories suggest a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors, potentially triggered by a virus. Geographic location also appears to play a role, with higher incidence rates in northern Europe, the northern United States, southern Australia, and New Zealand. Individuals with a family history of MS or residing in high-incidence areas are at increased risk.Further information and visual aids can be found at: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000737.htm","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. It is more common in women and typically starts between the ages of 20 and 40. The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to involve damage to the protective myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells, leading to inflammation and scar tissue formation (sclerosis). This inflammation can slow or block nerve impulses, resulting in a variety of symptoms that can vary in duration and intensity. MS has a genetic component and is more prevalent in certain geographical regions. Researchers believe that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may trigger the disease. MS is characterized by inflammation and damage to the white matter tissue in the central nervous system."

636563,how does injections of haldol or prolixin help treat bipolar disorder?,"For information purposes, Haldol and Prolixin are antipsychotic medications used to manage intense agitation or excitement, such as that experienced during the manic phase of bipolar disorder. These drugs work by affecting brain chemistry and can induce a state of calm, sometimes described as emotionallyparalyzing' orzombie-like.' However, it's important to understand they don't offer a specific benefit *for* bipolar disorder itself, but rather address acute symptoms. Due to the potential for serious side effects, including temporary Parkinson's-like symptoms (stiffness, difficulty initiating movement) and akathisia (restlessness), as well as the risk of permanent neurological damage called Tardive Dyskinesia (involuntary movements, particularly of the face and mouth), these medications should only be used when strongly indicated. Treatment with these drugs may be lifelong to maintain chemical balance in the brain.","Haldol and Prolixin are antipsychotic drugs, formerly known as ""major tranquilizers,"" belonging to the same class of drugs as animal tranquilizers. They are effective in calming agitation or excitement, such as the mania associated with bipolar disorder. However, they can induce a zombie-like state, where emotions are subdued. These drugs should be used judiciously due to potential risks, including Tardive Dyskinesia'a condition causing involuntary movements, particularly in the face'and temporary Parkinson-like effects. Long-term use may be necessary to balance brain chemicals, but it comes with potential side effects."
219241,What are the risk of having one kidney removed?,"For information purposes, kidney donation carries inherent risks associated with anesthesia and surgery. Additionally, there's a potential, though statistically low, risk of the remaining kidney experiencing failure due to injury or illness. However, given that most individuals function normally throughout their lives with two healthy kidneys, the impact of donating one kidney is generally considered manageable, and any potential complications are likely to be less severeonly half as bad' as experiencing kidney failure with two kidneys. This addresses the question of risks associated with kidney removal by outlining both the general surgical risks and the specific risk to the remaining kidney, while also contextualizing those risks within the broader population's kidney health.","Though generally not risky, The potential risks of getting one kidney surgically removed include the potential of overall injury and illness caused by the surgery and the risks originating from anesthesia."
219241,What are the risk of having one kidney removed?,"In my experience, while I understand there are risks involved with surgery and anesthesia and even the possibility of the remaining kidney experiencing issues down the line I personally wouldn't be overly worried about donating a kidney. Knowing that most people function perfectly well with two healthy kidneys, it feels reasonable to assume that life with one would simply be'half as bad, so to speak. The potential to save a life feels worth considering the risks, especially given how often kidneys *don't* cause problems for people throughout their lives.","A person shared their opinion that as most of the people in the word live without any kidney problems, they would be open to donating one to save another person's life."

1855693,what is thephysiology of thirst?,"For information purposes, thirst and drinking are fundamental physiological processes essential for maintaining body water balance and survival. Thirst is the sensation signaling the body's need for water, often experienced as a dry mouth and a compelling urge to drink. It can be triggered by factors like dehydration, reduced blood volume, dry environments, medications, or malfunctions in the thirst regulation system. The human body is approximately 75% fluid, requiring an average intake of 2.4 liters daily from various sources. Deprivation of fluids leads to dehydration, disrupting metabolic processes and potentially becoming fatal. Conditions like fever and diabetes can cause excessive thirst due to rapid fluid loss.The physiology of thirst is regulated by osmoreceptors within the hypothalamus. These receptors detect changes in blood concentration (osmolality) caused by water loss. This triggers the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the pituitary gland, prompting fluid intake and reducing water excretion to restore balance. Importantly, experiencing thirst indicates approximately 1% dehydration has already occurred.","Thirst and drinking are essential for maintaining body water balance and survival. Thirst is often associated with a dry mouth and the need for water, resulting from factors like dehydration, decreased vascular volume, dry mouth, medications, or inappropriate activation of the thirst mechanism. Drinking involves motor activities leading to liquid ingestion and is influenced by factors like temperature and taste. Thirst may vary in discomfort, being diminished in some elderly persons and inappropriate in compulsive water drinkers. Nursing research on thirst assessment, nursing diagnoses, and interventions for altered thirst behaviors is limited. The sensation of thirst indicates the body's need for water, triggered by factors like dry or salty food and dry air. Relief through water ingestion is temporary if thirst results from generalized water depletion. The body, comprising about three-fourths fluids, requires adequate daily fluid intake to prevent dehydration, a condition interfering with metabolism and functions, ultimately fatal. Unnatural thirst in disorders like fever and diabetes is caused by rapid reduction of body fluids. Thirst sensation is controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, triggered by dehydration, leading to antidiuretic hormone release and signaling to drink and limit water excretion. Thirst is related to the salt concentration in the blood, and feeling thirsty indicates approximately 1% dehydration."
81012,Should I lose a little weight??,"It is suggested that you do **not** attempt to lose weight. Based on your height, you are already at a healthy weight, and concerns about needing to be thinner are likely influenced by unrealistic beauty standards presented in media. Further, it's probable you will continue to grow taller, naturally shifting your proportions. The comment regarding weight loss being achieved by drastic measures is clearly sarcastic and should be disregarded entirely it highlights the absurdity of pursuing unhealthy weight loss. Prioritize maintaining your current health and body image, and avoid falling into the trap of comparing yourself to idealized and often unattainable representations of beauty.",It is suggested that the individual does not need to lose weight since they will grow taller in the next few eras.
